with halflead comes out almost better than pure tin
 or lead, even
though in any case they come out well. Nevertheless take care not to
cast lead at all as hot as tin. In big works it is necessary
    to moisten the sands with magistra or glair of egg.

Three things take the longest to make: leaves, hair &
garlands.


Sand

You should not choose for casting the one that is in any way so lean
& arid that it does not have bond, like the one from the
sea or from sandy
paths dried out by the sun. But choose
them  in the first place from
quarries or rock caves,
because that one is best, provided that it is very fine. You will recognize the
vein of it if, among the greyish rocks or quarries that seem to be made of arene,
you see, after rainy weather, certain small
patches like dust attached to the said rocks, or if due to the
humidity, a small piece of it flakes off, which easily crushes between your 
hands. You will also find in lean soils some which comes
off in  large lumps like stones of
tuf, or among terres
bolvenes, which are much better than those in
fatty & strong earths. And one ought not to take it from the
surface, for fear that it be mixed with common earth, but three
or 4 feet below & the closest to the
tuf or stone. Since it comes out in large lumps one would say that it starts to take shape as a stone. But when it is wet, it
comes apart easily. One needs to make sure that when breaking it up it
is quite granular, & that when cushed between the
fingers, it renders itself into very great subtlety, , keeping nevertheless its sandy asperity, without muddying the
fingers like clay. It is dried slightly on the
 fire, then it is pestled & passed finely through a double
sieve or a linen sleeve, then is moistened with
wine or magistra &c / Verte



The Toulousemolder reheats it strongly then grinds
it finely on marble and passes it through a
linen & moistens  it with
wine. He makes the cast very broad & 
flat & barely deep. He casts pure latton used for trebuschets
& similar thin things. He casts very hot.



Try calcined vitriol.
