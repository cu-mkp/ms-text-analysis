Against burns, excellent

Heat linseed oil on a gentle fire without letting
it boil & simmer, but once it is hot, put in a quarter as
much of the newest wax you can. Once melted, let it cool, &
once they begin to curdle, stir continuously with a new
wooden spatula for as long as it takes
you to say  9 paternoster, and as you say them,
wash this composition with holy water, stirring all the while.
Having said the first 9paternoster, pour out the
first water & put in new one, & wash & stir the
composition for the time it takes you to say 8 paternoster, and the 3rd time for as long as 7, & thus
you will consecutively  add new water, doing the
same as above, until the last & single paternoster of
nine. Then you shall have a soft & white ointment, with which
you shall anoint the burn for the space of 9 days.
But do not apply it any longer than this, for it would cause
 your flesh to grow excessively. You
 shall bandage yourself twice a day,
& each time you shall wash your face with water
& wine mixed together, a little tepid, not rubbing, but as if
pressing with a wet linen cloth, and you shall wipe it similarly
 with a fine linen cloth, & next put
the ointment, over which you can put ivy leaves.
This causes hair to regrow & leaves no scar. A
gunpowder maker who had almost completely burnt himself
 & showed no sign of the burn, taught me
this.


Against dogsâ€™ mange

The English, who caress their dogs a lot for
taking care of their livestock, have grooms for them, who
 particularly hold this office. And melting pitch
in water & leaving it to soak, they rub the dogs
with that water, or else with water of sublimate.
