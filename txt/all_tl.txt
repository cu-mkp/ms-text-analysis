For easing the belly
Prunes  of Saint Antonin  , and if you like you can put leaves of malva   and viola  , adding some sugar  and, if you like, some cinnamon   for the stomach.
Or in a chicken  broth , add some marshmallow  root . When fresh it is more mollifying.
Stirring together cirop de guindoles  doulces  with water  and taking some of this in the morning eases the belly.

Counterfeit coral 
+ One needs to first make the branches of wood  or take a bizarre thorn branch , then melt a lb  of the most beautifulclear pitch resin  and put in one ounce  of subtly ground vermilion  with walnut  oil , and if you add in a little Venice  lake platte  , the color will be more vivid, and stir everything in the resin  melted over a charcoal  fire and not of flame, for fear that the fire catches within. Next dip in your branches while turning, & if there should remain any filaments, turn the branch over the heat of the charcoal .
Colophony  is nothing other than resin  cooked again. To do it well, take a leaded  pot  & melt the resin , & boil it over the brazier  a good hour  , & until it appears not to be thick, but clear & liquid like water  & it easily runs & flows from the tip of a stick  with which you grind it, & try it. Then pour it through a coarse canvas   or a very light tammy cloth  , in the manner that when pouring it falls into the strongest vinegar  that you can find, for the vinegar  gives it strength & prevents it from being so fragile. Reiterate this two or three times & it will be beautiful & well purified. For imitating your coral , you can mix a quarter part  of mastic  within your purified resin  to render it more firm and more beautiful, & if you should take only a tear of mastic , it would be all the better, but it would be too long.

Sulfur  & vermilion  makes the same effect.

The coral  made of gules red enamel  endures the file  and polishing.

It is made like cement  that is stronger mixed with crushed than of  glass  rather than with brick . Thus one mixes here with the vermilion  the gules red enamel , which is red in body, well ground. Thus with all colors of enamels .

Varnish  for panels
Take a lb  of Venice  turpentine  & heat it in a pot  until it simmers, and put in half a lb  of the turpentine oil  of the whitest you can find, and stir it all together well on a charcoal  fire and take it off immediately. And elle   it is done. But if it seems too thick to you, add in a little more oil . Similarly if it is too clear, you can thicken it by putting a little turpentine . Thus you will give it whatever body you want. It could be made well without fire, but, when heated, it is more desiccative. It is appropriate for panel paintings and other painted things without distorting the colors or yellowing. And it dries both in the shade  and in the sun , and overnight , and during the winter  as well as in the summer . It is usually sold 15 sols  a lb .

A little more turpentine  than turpentine oil  is needed in order to give body to the varnish , which needs to be applied with finger   in order to spread it thinner and less thick, for when it is thick, it turns yellow and sticks. One does not varnish  to make paintings shine, for it just takes the light out of them.

But it is used to enhance colors which have soaked in and to keep them from dust. Mastic varnish  does not resist rain , whereas that of oil  and rosin  does.

Thick varnish  for floorboards
There is a varnish  that takes a long time to dry & still drips up to two months  after it has been applied to the floorboards. But this one does not drip like the one used in the past , which was made of linseed oil  boiled with garlic , to extinguish it & take out the fattiness, & with wheat . And this one yellowed & made the blue color of paintings greenish. This one is made like the other one except that one puts common thick turpentine 
 
 003v
 instead of fine turpentine . And you can put into two lbs  of tou common turpentine  one lb  of fine turpentine oil  & proceed as with the other one. This one will cost you no more than five or six sols   per lb  & is sold for 40 sols   per lb .
 This vessel  is used to make large quantities of turpentine oil , that is to say a bucket  an hour  . And no matter which turpentine  it may be, whether fine or coarse. One needs to give, as you know, a little fire at the beginning. And always keep cold water  in the cooler on the top. The lb  is sold at xii sols  , & at the bottom of the vessel  remains the colophony , known as pix graeca  . Eau de vie  are also made well in this vessel  and there is no need to distill it again. You do not need a small oven  for this copper vessel , but only charcoal  around it if it has a flat bottom, but if it is round, you will place it on a trivet .

@ It is better to heat the varnish  a little bit, rather than to put it out in the sun , because this makes the panel warp.

@ Some say it is not good to distil in this copper  vessel  because it is made green. However, when tinned , it is good.

For varnishing
Turpentine varnish  does not need any glue  because it is fat and viscous and it is not absorbed in the wood  like that of spike lavender   and sandarac . Also, that ofspike lavender  does not require any glue  on iron  & similar materials that do not absorb, but on wood  and on colors which have do not have gum  or colle de destrempe  , it is necessary to lay one coat of the said colle de retailles   & to let it dry & to varnish.

 004r
Varnish of spike lavender oil 
One needs to heat lavender spike oil  and as it begins to simmer, put in powdered sandarac gum  so that it soon melts. And over a charcoal  fire stir continuously until the sandarac  is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said varnish  on a plate . And if it is fatty when you handle it with a finger  , it is ready. And for one lb  of lavender spike oil , you will put five ounces  of pulverized sandarac , although some only put in four ounces , but this is not so good nor so fatty. This one is promptly dry. Framemakers , to avoid the trouble of polishing their ebony , varnish it with this, as do guitarmakers . This is not as appropriate for panels as that of fine turpentine , though it is good for the moldings of panels. One did not used to varnish the landscape of a panel when linseed varnish  was in use, because it would have yellowed the landscape. But with that of turpentine , one varnishes everything. You can put in pulverized mastic  extracted in tears or otherwise, and it will be more dessicative in place of sandarac .
If you want to varnish on plaster  or a wall, first put on your very hot colle de retaille  , because if cold it would not penetrate the wall, & when you would put your varnish  on, it would come off.
Varnish of spike lavender oil  is not as appropriate for colors as that of turpentine , for spike lavender oil makes them die eats away at  the colors since it is too penetrating.

To remove varnish  from an old panel that has yellowed & varnish it anew
Take white soap  & sieved  ashes , & soak both in water . And with a sponge , take the said ashes  & soap  & rub the panel with them. And as you see that the old varnish  is removed, throw a bucket   of water  against the panel to clean it. Next put it for a quarter of an hour  in the sun  to make it dry and to revive the colors. Next, once the panel dries, you can apply your turpentine varnish .

Make sure the colors do not come off.

 004v
Black varnish  for sword guard, bands for trunks, &c.
Take linseed  oil  or more cheaply, walnut  oil , and rid it of fattiness with garlic   & onions   + hog's fennel   some also add bread crusts  , which you will boil in it for a good quarter of an hour  . Then add to one lb  of the oil  thus boiled a piece of black pitch the size of a walnut   & a double handful  of wheat grain  , without removing the garlic   & onions   and let it boil together for a good quarter of an hour  . And when the pitch  is well melted & the oil  has body, you can remove it from the fire. Then, to varnish, place your iron  over a low charcoal  fire & apply your varnish  with a feather  or a brosse  . And when you see that it no longer smokes, it is done and your varnish  is dry.

For excellent black varnish , add two or three paternoster beads  of jet  among the rest.

Some consider walnut  oil  better.

If there is a lot of varnish , it needs to boil for at least half a day  , for it is better the more it boils. It is dangerous if the fire catches within, if it goes over the top, and is hard to extinguish. Make this therefore in a courtyard  or an open space .

In five or six lb  of oil , one must put one lb  of galipot , which costs 4 sols  , & some peeled garlic  cloves . This varnish  itself is not black, but blackens over the fire.

See below, around the 3rd part of this book, after sands, in the chapter on furbishers .

Black varnish  without fire, without disassembling the harnesses or removing the bands from trunks
Take varnish of spike lavender  oil  & mix it with soot black  or lampblack , & without fire it will mix in by itself. Varnish with a brosse   & it will soon be dry. Turpentine varnish  will be quite good, but it does not dry as soon.

Varnish ofiron engravers  
Take linseed  oil  or walnut  oil  &, in place of black pitch , you will put in a little resin , & it needs to be cooked in the manner of black varnish  on fire. And for applying it, heat your iron  & give it only one layer of varnish , & when it no longer smokes, it is dry. Next engrave with a steel  point  whatever you want. Next take salt  & verdigris  & soak as much of one as of the other in quite strong vinegar  & leave it for XX4 hours   before using it, & all will be soaked. Next spread some of this liqueur or sauce on the engraved object with a sponge 
 
 005r
 or linen   & leave it thus for xx4 hours   & it will be engraved. But if you should want to engrave quickly, varnish all your work & boil it in the aforesaid liquor, and it will engrave quickly.

Steel  mirrors
+ They are called steel mirrors  because in the past they were usually made of steel  polished with emery paste . But more easily, various kinds are made of cuivre franc , which is rosette  and tin , because these can be cast in a mold and made round, hollow, convex or in whatever various shapes you want to represent.
So take half copper de rosette  and half soft tin , i.e. fine and yet unused. Place them in a crucible, and first melt the copper . Once it has been well melted, add the tin  and mix them together and cast that in a white stone  mold with no hole, and grease the mold, which should be moderately warm, with oil . Then, once your mirror has been molded, you can polish it in this manner.
Set one mirror  in plaster  to hold it firmly, then put the other one over it with fine sand between them, and rub one against the other, whether they are hollowed or flat, and thus you will polish both at once. If you want to polish them on both sides, you only have to switch them, which means putting the one that was polishing in the plaster  and using  the one which was in the plaster  to polish. Once they have been polished with arene  you can soften them with tripoli of Venice  that should not be sand y, and then with paste . You use water  with arene  to polish, but polishing with tripoli  and paste  is done dry. Once the mirror  has been polished, you can set it.

Concave mirrors
A concave mirror shaped in the aforesaid form produces an endless number of illusions which seem like magic. If one wants to see oneself from behind, you have to place the concave mirror on the ground on its foot, at a slant, and then look at it one step further. But if you look at it from a closer position, it shows you the right way up but with the face quite large and the hairs of your beard as thick as
 
 005v
 a string and will reflect a nipple  as large as a plate, and women can see the secret places they do not want to show to surgeons . It projects the reflection outwards, and if you touch with your finger  the eye of the reflection, another finger  will come against yours.
You will be able to provide light at night for someone quite far away, if you set the concave mirror behind a candle placed on a window sill. You will be able to read and write quite far from the candle if you set it behind the candle and turn the concave face towards you. If you put the mirror at the far end of a table with a candle on it, it will reflect two lights on the table for you. To see what is happening in a street, shut the window, or the more you can shut the better, make a hole in the bottom pane , the size of your little finger  , perfectly round all the way through. Then apply a sheet of paper onto the window and let the middle of the sheet be over the hole. Pierce the sheet in the same place as the hole and of the same size. Then turn the concave face of the mirror towards the hole, and anyone passing by in the street will be reflected on the sheet of paper. Do the same with the pierced door of a closed room. You can make wavy mirrors  and triangular ones, such as are described by Ptolemy and Archimedes. The concave sort can also set fire to straw or light a candle from afar, using the sun. By reverberating fire too, it can provide warmth.

For bronzing in yellow and white
Take mirror tin  and melt it. On half a pound of this, put half an ounce of quicksilver , and remove it immediately from the fire and grind it until it is like ashes. Wash it thoroughly in clean water , then grind it on a marble  slab  and soak it with water of glue de retailles . Then apply that on your wooden candlesticks and any other works you like, and burnish with a tooth . You can grind pin filings  and apply them with the said glue de retailles  . 

 006r
For laying down and setting burnished gold  and giving red or green or blue
Ceruse  & lead white  is not appropriate for polished white nor for burnishing because it is fatty, but it is quite good for or mat  that is made with oil  by mixing it with yellow ochre  & mine p o  & by tempering all of it with oil . And this or mat  thus applied keeps in the rain  like gilded leadwork  & similar things. Therefore for burnished gold  take good chalk, quite white, well ground , & soaked with distemper glue , & make four layers of it, one after the other, on the wood . And once the last is dry, rub it with prele   , which is a plant otherwise called horsetail  , to render it well polished. Next take fine Armenian  bole  & sanguine , as much of one as of the other, lamb  tallow  as large as a bean   or a pea   depending on the quantity of bole , and a little of willow  charcoal  or as much as the tallow , & half a walnut  shell  full of half-burned saffron  . Some put in a little candi sugar . Grind all together with water , & apply it without gum  or glue , & let it dry, & rub the place that you want to gild with a piece of white cloth  to better make even, & when the rubbed place is a little shiny, it is a sign that the gold  will carry itself well. Having rubbed, wash with a clean pinceau   soaked in clear water  the place that you want to gild & immediately apply the gold , which you will burnish once dry. And if you want to lay in rouge clair   & glaze with it de  , grind Venice  lake platte   on marble   with walnut  oil  or linseed  . Once ground, mix turpentine varnish or spike lavender   & apply on the gold  with the pinceau  . Brazilwood   & lake ronde   die. For green, temper verdigris  with walnut oil   or linseed   & grind, next mix in turpentine varnish and not of spike lavender  , which is not suitable for verdigris . If you want to glaze with azure , it needs to be set on burnished silver  and take azur d’esmail  , &, without grinding, temper it with turpentine varnish  & apply it.


 006v
For cages
You can embellish them with thin enamel canes  of various colors by covering the yellow latten  or iron  wire with said canes. These you will break neatly into the length that you want if you make a small notch with a cutting file  at the point where you want to break them, and they will not break anywhere else. You can bend them with a wood en model over a brazier or by the heat of a lamp . A cane can be stretched out as long as you want in a small furnace  made like a reverberatory oven  but with openings on both sides. And once the large cane is red, they seize the hot end of it with small pincers  that have long beaks, with one end of the beak inside the end of the cane, so that it may be stretched without becoming blocked. The other end of the cane is held with the hand, as it is not hot. Once the cane is stretched enough, the one who is working seated with his stove , the size of a carnation pot, placed in front of him, breaks it off and carries on. This is for making canes for capes, which may be cut, as already mentioned, with a file . Glass-button makers  also use the said stove .
 
Under the door is a grill that supports the burning charcoal . The ash  is emptied by turning the stove  upside down.

For stamped ornaments used for embellishing and inserting into or covering the edges of mirrors, the tops of chests, or the friezes of bed valances
Etch with aqua fortis  on iron  or copper  whatever you have pounced and drawn there, next make it neat with a burin  or chisel . Then pour soft tin , yet unused, onto polished marble  and flatten it, making it quite thin, with a wood en board. Or else pour it on a table as is done with lead , or put it through a roll-press . Next lay your tin  plate over the engraving, and over the tin  plate put a piece of felt  and strike it with a hammer . Then gild it in the following manner.

 007r
For gilding with gold color  and tinsel 
Once you have gilded colored , make your stamped ornament in tin  as said, or in iron dest   or copper , one ought not to put a layer ofglue  here as on wood , but take only fatty oil , which is made in seven or eight days in the sun  with walnut oil  and lead white & with , stirring it often, or cooking it on the fire if one is in haste. Then, with the oil  thus made fatty, grind a little lead white , massicot  & mine de plomb    , at discretion, as much of one as of the other. Minium  gives color to the gold . Next, with this, you make a layer of it evenly on your stamp, taking care not to fill the hollows. And once it is almost dry, lay the gold  leaf on it with cotton . Such gold  will hold up in the rain  on houses & elsewhere. And if you have gilded with tinsel , color it with fumée de perdrix   or from yellow or red cloth , & it will be beautiful like pure gold . You can cover trunks, mirrors, canopies & posts of beds of colored velvet  or satin  and then apply the gilded stamped ornament on them with strong glue .

For coloring stamped trunks
The stamp of sheets of copper or latten  is made on service tree wood  engraved & cut should you want to spend less. And next, the stamped object is colored with the aforesaid colours of lake , verdet , azur d’esmail  , & soak in turpentine varnish . But in the place you want to azure , lay down fer blanc  , which is more appropriate for an azure  background.

Doublets
Good dragon 's blood  soaked in eau de vye  carries its mastic  or glue  in itself, so do sap-green  & saffron  .

Fish  glue  or usblac  and mouth glue 
It is made from codfish  skin  that has been boiled rather than salted . Joiners  use it on their masterpieces and guitar makers  use it for their more delicate works. It needs to be strongly beaten, then soaked gently in barely boiling water .
Mouth glue  is made of parchment  scraps and used to glue paper  or similar things without fire, by wetting it with one's mouth  .

It is beaten and left to soak in white wine  for one night, then melted over a low heat. Others soak it in spirits .

 007v
For giving the color of all kinds of metals  to wood  & other things
Take touchstone  & pumice stone  as much of one as of the other & grind them together & mix with a glue de retailles  stronger than that used for painting, & paint it on whatever you like. Once dry, rub this layer with any metal  whatsoever, then burnish it.

Against windy colic
Take a dozen dried common walnuts   and throw them one after another onto a good brazier  where they may catch fire, and take them out with tongs , and let them burn and flame well in the air, and extinguish them in a glass of good wine . Then let the wine  cool and filter it, then pour half of it, since six extinguished nuts  make one dose. An excellent cure against suffocation of the matrix.

To relieve the pain of gout 
Take half a pound of finely powdered golden and yellow marcasite , half an ounce of storax , 4 lb. of urine , incorporate well together, little by little, in a mortar , then boil all together quite strongly. But the pot needs to be well covered so the smoke does not escape. Then distill the imbibed urine , separated by inclination, in an alembic , well luted and covered with a copper  head. And soak a cloth with the said water  and apply it lukewarm on the pain.

Against gonorrhea
Cook .i. lb. of old smiths' water , .i. ℥ of Armenian  bole  reduced in the finest powder, and .iii. ʒ of common honey , until the honey  stops foaming. Once cooled, strain with great pressure and use the results of filtration by injection.

Tempering bullets to pierce bullet-proof armor
Heat the lead  bullet as much as you can without melting it, and once it is hot dip it into the strongest vinegar  that you can. And do this four or five times. Afterwards, mince some lard  very finely and some linen  also very delicately, mix all this together and use it as wadding, making it go into the arquebus or pistol with a little strength and very tightly. And before shooting, if possible, the bullet should be hot.

To make a breach in a wall by night
Having made a hole in a wall as you know, put one mortar inside, charged with powder , almost flat, and another upright, then fill in the hole and fire.

Polishing of the balas ruby 
It is not polished with tripoli but  like the others, but with marcasite powder  & oil .

Or moulu   et argent moulu  
You need to calcine your fine gold  with ☿   and then wipe your amalgam well & make the said mercury  fly off. Next grind it on marble   with gum water . As for silver  one needs to take it as is & eat away at it with aqua fortis  , then take it out with a copper  blade  & rinse it thoroughly and next grind it with gum water .

Polishing stones 
There are three wheels for doing this, one of tin , one of lead , & one of fine copper  , on the cu  copper  wheel  one does not commonly cut co   or polish but the diamond , the  ruby , sapphire , &  oriental jacinth . The tin  wheel  is for more tender stones like emerald , amethyst , & others.

Pewterers ' mixture   
Because among the fine tin they often mix well half  of lead , which renders the tin  dull. To correct this, they mix in some latten filings  to render it sonorous .

Perfect amalgam
Take the most delicate stoneware  you can find, with a cavity in the middle. Put in an eighth part  of ☿  in  & rub it & wear it down while adding water , urc  , ☾   or ☼   until the substance becomes like paste & even harder. Next, if you want, eat it away with good aqua fortis  , if it is ☾   or ♀  . Then remelt it, having taken it out as you know. The ☾   will be colored, and having been melted, will leave some grains of ☼  , & the ♀   will be very fine & will have almost no chappe .

Plowman 
Since millet    is naturally very dry, harvesters  thresh it most often in the cool of night and in moonlight. Which could not be done with another, wetter, grain  , because you must let the sunbeams pass over it, and one rarely threshes it before midday. Immediately after the millet    is harvested, the earth needs to be plowed because its roots eat and make lean the soil  as much as if the millet    was still standing. The ground where millet    will have been sown becomes quite diminished in fertility, which you can tell next time it is sown. But more than any other the grain  called pomole    in Gascony or baillard    in northern  France , makes the earth shake, according to the common saying, seven years later. Broad beans   improve and enrich the soil, provided that one lets the roots and stems rot in it.

Painters 
Some, having laid down their color, soften it with the back of a feather  but the large brush  is best.

Merchants 
They commonly have four books. The tiro, which is a formulary for apprentices, by which they can know how much every item of merchandise costs and for how much it should be sold. The second is the waste book, where they put down in rough what they sell daily. The third is the sales book, where they put down the clean copy and detailed account of what is contained in the waste book. The fourth is the ledger, which mentions the sale, the balanced account, the bill and the term of payment, and this book is accepted as evidence in court.

 009v
Painters 
They completely melt orpiment  in a glass  bottle  on very hot ashes, but it would be more appropriate to sublimate orpiment  in a long-necked matrass  as for making garnets . The orpiment  thus turns red like red enamel  & one needs to grind it damp because once completely melted it is very lively & difficult to grind. Next, you can br   thin it, once dry, with oil  & it will make a deep yellow of heightened color. But to prevent orpiment  from dying with the other colors & to render it compatible with these & to make it dry promptly, it is a most rare secret to calcine common salt  & to grind it within. Green verditer  is not used with oil .

Counterfeit jasper 
Take horn  from which one makes lanterns, quite thin, & underneath make the figure of your jasper , cornalines , & other stones , which will be a work more appropriate than on glass , which is too shiny. And the horn  presents a lustre & a fatty polish like jasper .
You know, as with scrapings of the said horn , the roses   can be imitated. The horn  colors for this jasper  wants to have a base with clear turpentine  or spike lavender  varnish . And colors matte in body are not so appropriate here, however beautiful they are. One needs to oil  the unpainted reverse with spike lavender  oil . 

Thin glass , for this effect, is very beautiful.

You can encrust beds with it & on the joints you can throw the filings of talc or of pins  on the fresh cement  of the said joints. One needs to join them with gum ammoniac  mixed in vinegar . To better counterfeit marbled jasper , apply wool of thick hairs  dyed in diverse colors & intermingled. After you have laid down all the colors, scrape oblique lines on them, then lay down gold &silver leaf . If you lay down on the horn  colors of turpentine , give it a base of silver  or of tin leaf . You can also file horn  & mix it with strong glue , & lay it down onto the joints of the piece of horn , then even it with a plane .

It is made in Lyon  from the juice of weld  & chalk  mixed together or better yet with ceruse , which is appropriate for distemper  and oil . 

Roses 
These are counterfeited either with the scrapings of   horn used for lanterns , or with scrapings of parchment , very clear, delicate & dyed, employed as you know.

Purple color
Painters  make it beautifully by making the first layer of common azur , or better yet azur d'esmail  , & next they glaze it with lake , which will be more appropriate for this if you mix in alum , which gives it a violet tint depending on the quantity that you mix in.

Powder for hourglasses
It is made very subtle & not subject to rust &by its weight able to flow. Taking i lb  of lead , melt it and skim and purify it from its filth, then pour into it four ℥  of finely pulverized common salt , and take good care that it has no stones  nor earth. And immediately after you have poured it, mix continuously very well with an iron tool  until the lead  and salt  are well incorporated, and take it immediately from the fire, stirring continuously. And if it seems too coarse, grind it on the marble   and pass it through a fine sieve , then wash it as many as times as necessary until the water  becomes clear, throwing out the fine powder that will float on it, renewing the water  as many times as necessary until it is all even.

For painting in oil  on taffeta without the oil  running 
One needs to make a layer of batture  , which is made of well cooked honey & turpentine   of colle forte   soaked for 24 hours  in water  then gently bring to the boil so that it is hardly strong. Next stir in a little honey  to soften it, & let it boil all together. And on top of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in oil , which will soften the layer even more, and which can also serve to make a ground layer for gold . Water of alum  also keeps oil  from running.

Ground layer for gold leaf  on parchment  or paper 
Make very clear starch glue , showing no body. And make thereof six or five layers, & on the last, once it is half dried, apply your gold .

Painting esmail d’azur in oil 
This is a secret that is hardly known to common painters . Some take the most delicate they can & grind it with ceruse , which binds it, and next prick with an awl  in several places the area they want to paint with azur d’esmail , such that the oil  enters & leaks in, & ne   does not cause the azure , which in itself is heavy, to run. Others lay the panel flat & put down the azure  on it, which is also done à destrempe . The main thing is to grind it well on marble  , and before that, to have washed it thoroughly. Some grind it with  thoroughly with an egg yolk  & then wash it in five or six waters    and lay it on not with a  painceau  , which would be too soft, but with a broisse   thoroughly softened & crimped, & laying it on thickly as if one were putting it down with a trowel ; settling down it evens out and flattens. I have experienced that grinding azur d’esmail   with egg yolk  & next washing it in several waters   is good. However, it loses a little of its vividness in the grinding of it. I have also washed it in several waters   &, when it had settled a little, I removed the water  , still q  blue, with a sponge  and squeezed it into another vessel thus where it settled, & from the residue  I had the ash, flower and subtlest part of the azure  without grinding it, which is the best, for in the grinding of it, it loses some of its tint. Those who make it in Germany  compound it like enamel , in large pieces which they crush, & pass through several sieves  & wash.
To make azures  beautiful, they wash or soak them in a rock water  , as they call it; it is a water  distilled from mines where azure  or vert d'azur   is found, which distills naturally through the veins of the mountain  or is distilled through an alembic par   from mineral stones of azure  or copper .
Azure  ash  are only good for landscapes because they die in oil . Only true azure  holds on. Azur d’esmail  cannot be worked if it is too coarse. Try it, therefore, on the fingernail   or the oil  palette . If it    happens to be sandy, do not grind it except with the egg yolk  or, better yet, wash it in clear water   & with a sponge  remove the colored water   after it starts to go to the bottom, and in this manner you will extract the very delicate flower, which will be easy to work with.

One rubs them with diamond pumice stone powder  . One needs also to unpolish on a lead  wheel  either the stone  or the glass  on which you want to engrave, for the polish, which is like varnish  on glass , prevents the diamond  or sapphire  from biting well. But  This is why it does not bite easily on the hoof , which is polished & fatty. But when the polish is taken off, it bites easily.

Molding sulfur 
Sulfur  is made beautiful mixed with soot black  or with pulverized sanguine , which renders it harder and stronger. Having let it melt well until it becomes liquid, like oil , mix it with verdigris , and you m   will cast in plaster  very neat a lizard , or something else.

You must not cast that which has not become well cooled & that which has not lost all its lumps & bubbles, and has not settled down well & become smooth like   water . The soot black  gives it a fine luster & makes it neater. The most beautiful yellow sulfur  must be used, for the greyish & lively sulfur  is not good. Do not cast in wind  & cold , for it would become porous.

Chimolee  
The terre chimolee  , otherwise known as fuller ’s earth , from which they finish the cloth , is excellent for molding hollow or in relief; & if you want to reheat it, it must first be warmed, & reheat it gently on a low, indirect fire, & little by little, otherwise it would crack. Put the figure to reheat in a pot  in an oven , or in a covered oven . It is very malleable, clean & fine. You can make a cavity for animals of chimolee   & cast lead  in it. 

The work needs to be dried for 4 or 5 days  before you reheat it. When you mold & make a cavity from chimolee  , do not press too hard, but softly, for it would break.

Paper 
The whitest & finest is the best. And when the cavity is quite clean, as of sulfur  or baked chimolee  , it is made very neatly. You can give it one or two layers of white  with a border of gold  to imitate alabaster . And after you have applied the white , you can burnish it with the  tooth . But in order for it to be burnished, one needs to mix the lead white  with glair of egg  & peelings from the fig tree  . Or better, varnish your work with white varnish . In addition when you are molding with paper , as it starts to dry, burnish from the back with the tooth .

Plaster 
That from the mountains  is greyer, and the  the one from the region of Albi  is whiter. It must be heated over a closed fire, such as a reverberatory furnace  or fours de barbiers  . And the most freshly cooked is the best. It must be finely ground on marble  . After having prepared your cavity from sulfur  or something else, & oiling  it, & having enclosed it in a circle , temper not too thickly your plaster  with water , & separate it well with your finger  , and if it makes lumps, throw in more powder of the said plaster  &    grind it with the finger   until + 
+  it makes no more lumps. Then cast & sprinkle again with plaster powder  & leave to set well, then scrape off the powder.

For whitening enilanroc 
Some think that the crust of ceruse  color which is natural on top, others say that it is a secret of ancient lapidaries  that is lost, others say that it is reheated enamel . And by means of the said crust, multiple ciphers, letters, circles st   & other oddities can be formed. As for the method, I have practiced thus. Once I wished to give it a layer of arsenic  ground on marble  . However, I experimented without this, and I put the above said thing, enilanroc , in a small iron  casket  on the fire of my goldsmith 's forge  with three or four small half-burnt coals , and blew only with my mouth . And, however, the thing came to redden &  ignite & became all white, not only on its surface but also inside, & at that time I let it cool on its own near the fire , for otherwise, exposing it suddenly to cold air, it would have burst. Once all white, I passed it through my lead   wheel of tin  , where I found it as hard as before, & uncovering a little white, I found it a fair carnation. Finally, I polished it & saw that it took a very beautiful polish & could be compared to a very beautiful agate  for cutting some beautiful face on it & bringing it on the  a table of

 
 013r
 agate  of various color. But because this total whiteness did not respond to make this white crust on the surface that I was seeking, leaving the rest of the thing of its natural color, I made a opening in a brick  of the exact size of the thing & put it inside. Then I reddened two glassmaker 's s[a]olders , & as they were red, I presented them one after the other onto the surface of the thing until I got the white crust that I required, on which I made such drawing as I wanted, uncovering up to the red base with a diamond  point , and I polished it with hog  bristles   and tripoli  . I do not know if it would be better to reheat it under hot ashes , & if it would be good to encase it in alabaster , which is very cold, as I encased it in the brick .

Carnation from arsenic 
Sublimated arsenic , t[b]hat is to say, the white one that is sold as stone , when ground on marble  , mixed with vermilion  or lake  or minium , makes a beautiful flesh color that is always shiny. Yellow arsenic  has a very beautiful color, the white one is good in oil  and agrees well with the lake .

Fine sieves  of raw silk 
One makes tammy of raw silk  on a weaver, to make very fine and delicate sieves . And for that effect, you must not choose raw silk  whitened by sulfur  smoke: this renders the silk  charged with a sticky vapor that would hold the flour and in the end would prevent it from

To know the good azurite ash  for oil 
The one that piles up in small clods and is lumpy is the best because it is the most subtle. Also the one that is also very pale in color, because oil  darkens it. Certain sophisticators  mix them, but you will know this if you pour some onto a piece of paper  & lay it flat & smudge it with the finger   since, if it is mixed, it will be found variegated & as if with pale & darker stripes, but if it is unmixed it will be even & of one color.

For earth  walls and rustic construction
Swallows  have taught us this craft by building their nests out of mud  mingled with wisps  and bits of hay  or straw  to make it bond. Therefore, in places where stones  and bricks  are lacking, one can use earth  to make walls thin and thick. The best for this is light earth , which does not form clumps when plowed, or better, that which in some way mingled with arene , because it can be most easily beaten and tamped down. It is true that it needs to be dampened and cut into clumps with a ditch-spade , and put and placed in this form. This one lasts more and does not require that much effort, and dryness doesn't make it split or crack. However, since such kinds of earth are not found everywhere, those who live on good and fertile land, after drawing the width and length of their foundations with a rope , drive in long poles  and rafters  along the edges on each side to support boards between which they throw the earth , making each layer about one foot thick, interspersed with S.S.S -shaped branches of heather   or similar things, then they tamp it down and beat it with beaters of three different forms. One is called the mall, which has a triangular form like A, and this is used firstly to tamp down the earth . Then one uses another made of pointed woodblocks  fitted onto a thick stick , and this one is used to properly press the earth  at the wall’s ends and edges where they adhere to the boards, and is called  . The other one is called the bat and is used to flatten and beat the earth  for the last time, as shown in C. Then one makes another layer of earth  and heather   and beats as has been said, and continues thus until completing the wall, which is covered with heather   and then with earth . Some intersperse the said wall with rows of bricks . They also make walls with a sloped foot, adding width to the foundations according to how high they want to build the wall. When it is old it whitens, showing that it has saltpeter  in it. Which is why, when they fall down, gunpowder makers  profit from them.

Damasked Cloth 
You can damask a  cloth  of two different colours and imitate embroidery without adding anything else to it, as follows. Once it is is dye d yellow, pounce onto it such a pattern as will please you. Then you will sew some string  or a bigger cord  loosely onto the pattern and throw it into a dye  of woad  or pastel  and it will become green, except that which is beneath the string , which will remain yellow because the green dye  will not have penetrated there. And you can do the same with other colours and, instead of string  or cord , add some pieces of poor quality cloth  cut in Moorish shapes on top of the first colour. In that manner, you will have cheap embroidery.

Casting molten metals 
One casts candlesticks and small works in a frame  with sand. And after having imprinted the work, one sprinkles the frame with flour  in order to make the  e metal  copper  or latten  run better. When the sand has been used for a month , it is necessary to take some new sand, because the one that was used, having been reheated in fire + , dries out & loses its ability to bond. However, it is used to mix with the new sand, for it makes the work not so porous. One casts large works such as artillery, bells & similar things in earth , & copper  cast in earth  makes less of a chappe , and is whiter than the one cast in sand. The earth  is sandy clay  mixed with horse  dung  & cloth  waste. The earth  that is  has been used for casting, which is black, baked & as if burnt, is used to cast, gecte   mixed with artificial sand , & is very good. To soften & make the copper  run, throw in, once it is melted, a little lead , which does not form an alloy but is found on the surface of the cast.

Casting gold  and silver 
The sand must be from something very dry & arid & reheated well in the frame , because, if it were humid, like founder 's sand , the gold  and silver  would spatter, & cause damage. It is also necessary for the earth  to absorb the metal , for cast gold  or silver is  become very spongy. That is why it must be beaten again, otherwise it is brittle, as one sees in spoon handles.

Melting soft iron 
It is a common opinion that once iron  has been melted, it cannot be remelted because they only heat it in small forge s, in which it only catches fire. Alchemists  are confident they can melt it with realgar , lead  or orpiment . But without all that, some have found a way to melt not only brittle iron , like that used for iron  pots, but also soft iron  such as pig or ingot iron , which are the most difficult ones to work with . For this result they make a furnace  that is one pan   and a half wide and two pan  s deep, and the tuelle , which is the barrel marked A where the bellows' pipes  fit, has to be placed midway through the depth of the furnace so that there is one pan   of the furnace  opening on the tuelle  and one pan   under it.

Each square pan   of the furnace 's opening can hold one quintal and a half , and the round furnace pan   can hold two quintals .
 
The iron  smiths , to make the iron  run, at the opening of the forge , place two or three handfuls of wallwort  in the direction  they want to make the cast iron  run, and that makes the iron  wonderfully ductile and flowy.
It is necessary that the tuelle  is inserted through  to the middle of the furnace  opening, which is a main clue for the secret because the wind will hit the edge and the wall, which makes up the center of the furnace  and in that manner, it spreads equally everywhere, as well as above, like flames in a reverberatory oven, and thus heats much more; because if the wind  hits the melted or ready to be melted matter perpendicularly, it would cool it down and it would stop it from running and melting. It is also necessary for the bellows  to be activated by jumps and by the water  stream as happens  at forges , because in this way, bellows  are activated with great precision and great speed, which the strength of workers  could not duplicate. As you can see, the wall is thus raised up and the furnace is laid  on the ground, at the edge of which you dig a pit, like at other forges . In order to put the moulds you want to cast inside, and for this purpose, you unstop the opening that you made at the bottom of the furnace  to allow the melted matter to flow. You will be able to melt two quintals  of iron  each time and, in order to do this, you will choose the biggest charcoal  you will find and put a measure of it at the bottom on the surface area of the furnace and pile up from the bottom to the top of the wall, in the shape of an upside down V .

Some make a mould of the same size as the piece, then immerse it, then beat a soft iron  piece cut to size, and when this bit is red hot, they beat it into the mould and round it out with a large file . These bullets are thought to be stronger than the melted ones which, being made of hard iron , are more prone to break.
 
 016v
 which is usually of 3 pan  s high. But first of all, you have to reheat your furnace  with some big charcoal , so the bottom is red hot and then you will put the said charcoal  measure in the middle of which you will put your iron , not at once but ten or fifteen pound s each time. And since it will be swallowed at the furnace  bottom, keep putting some more. And add three or four shovel s of bigger charcoal  and avoid it from getting consumed too quickly by wetting it. And when you will see your furnace  full of two quintal s of matter, or less if you don't have that much, you will leave the charcoal  consume itself. And when the charcoal  is almost dying at the furnace 's level, you will be able to pour in the moulds and iron  or metal  shells, which is even better for one metal  will bite the other. And the inside of the mold has to be covered with soaked ashes , so it doesn't adhere to it.

If it is otherwise all cotton  made, as those of Montauban  do, it needs to be snuffed out often because if it has been burning for a while, cotton  falls down and make the candle drip.

On cannon-makers 

A cannon has a range of five to six hundred paces , but for a battery, the range is a maximum of two or three hundred paces  to be effective. It should not be any farther. Its cannonball usually weighs 40 lb  of the King's standard. The fowler weighs 25 quintals  and is a small, short cannon for fighting the casemates of moats and at close range. It shoots large cannonballs that weigh, like the others, 40 lb  of the King's standard. The breech is two balls and a quarter thick; the mouth is one ball and a third thick. Its load is similar to the biggest ones, that is to say 20 pounds . And if you want to try it, don't overload it, for it would damage it. And the first time and the first five or six shots, it is better not to load it completely, it adjusts itself. What one can do in such a case, is to load 20 pounds  of fine arquebus powder  instead of ordinary cannon powder . And four good horses  are enough to carry it. They are easy to use and on a small distance they are as strong as the big ones even for private houses and small billattes  and less important fortresses. They are less prone to breaking than other cannons  because they are short. What gives strength to the powder  and increases the danger of breaking is the length of the cannon, because the powder  burns entirely and its force is held longer within the longer cannon than the short one. The fowler is usually seven to eight pans   long. It is true that this measure is a Montpellier pan   and not a King's pan , the latter is not used for good cannon founding. Since the Montpellier pan   is shorter, cannons made using this measure are shorter, but compensate in thickness the ones made using the King's pan  , which are longer, but more fragile. The Fowler's strength for battery is 80 pans  .

The great cannon, because of its cannonball's weight, ranges not further than a thousand or twelve hundred paces  without landing, and usually makes 3 jumps.

Fowlers have only a short range efficiency.

You recognize a cannon's good alloy when you see it. If there is green color on the surface becomes red, it means they are made of a sufficient quantity of rosette . Otherwise, the cannon's metal  will appear whitish. If you don't see it, just scratch it and you will see it. 

The good alloy for the cannon is three pans   of rosette  and one of big bells' fine metal , where there is more rosette  than in small bells' metal . This metal  usually costs 15 pounds  and fine rosette  15 or 16.
Montpellier pan   is equivalent to six King's inches , which is equivalent to two ordinary. 

To level a cannon properly, one needs to have the mouth as high as the breech. Otherwise, you do not aim well.

 The large canon is for great batteries and usually weighs fifty five or 60 quintal s. The breech is two cannonball and three quarters each. The mouth is one cannonball and three quarters each. It is thirteen or fourteen pan s  in length. But they are very uneasy to drive. The proper battery, to be used rapidly and to have great impact, is a hundred fifty to two hundred pace s. It is true that a fair impact can be had from three or four hundred pace s, but more powder  is needed. Its usual load is 20 pound s of powder ; its cannonball weighs 40 pound s, and 25 horses  are required to carry it. When one needs a longer range than the usual one, half a linstock   of canon powder  is added. 80 or a hundred shots can be made with this canon per day, but it needs to be cooled down after each nine or ten shots if the battery is continuously used; if there are some breaks, it is not necessary to refresh it as often. For each quintal  of copper  - or one quintal  and a half for big cannons - a quintal  of metal  is added. The metal  is composed of eight pound s of tin  for each quintal  of rosette  and even less for big bells for which we use only six pound s of fine tin  for a quintal  of rosette , to give it a louder voice. Because the more tin  there is, the clearer the sound is. For canon founding, if the material and charcoal  is provided as it is usually done because master s cannot afford it, it costs 10 to 12 pound s per quintal . And when the master  provides everything, you give him 40 pound s per quintal  for big pieces such as cannons, according to the King's ordinance. And 50 pound s for smaller pieces. For the more matter there is, the more the master  makes profit. Another kind of 30 quintal 's fowler is founded which is longer than the others, and usually 8 pan s  long, which is used to attack fortifications and cassemattes  by displaying them, at night, in groups on the moat's edge.
◯ 
Each side of the breech's opening is half a cannonball thick, plus a third of a cannonball.
We give it two linstock   of cannon powder  for its load, and half a linstock   of arquebus powder  and the same for the others.

The alloy of cannons from France  is made of one quintal  of metal for two of rosette . But those of Toulouse  and Ponce t put 3 quintal s of rosette  for one of metal.
 The rosette  used to remelt is better than rosette  for cauldrons, for the latter get all dirty.

The older pieces are composed of almost as much of each, that is to say a part of rosette  and one of metal. This alloy can be recognized with a burin  because the matter is acid and the part scraped off with the burin  is yellow and white.

Culverines are big batteries of forty quintal s and eighteen pan  s long. Their bullet of the King's standard  and battery weighs 30 pound s and is therefore lighter than the canon's one. Therefore, It does not carry so many munitions because fifteen pound s are enough for its load. The canon has a bigger mouth due to the size of its cannonball, but the colverine is more precise and goes faster, having greater range due to its length. Its breech is two bullets and a third thick, the front is a bullet thick. Culverines are used for fighting fortifications from far away when it is not possible to easily approach them. And then canons come closer. They are used also to support the battery. Fifteen or sixteen horse s are necessary to carry it. They are made of the same metal alloy than the canon, like all others smaller pieces of artillery . For these, we add a little bit more metal in order to make the melting run better. And for two quintal s of rosette , you add six unit of metal per pound for smaller pieces. They range from 8 or 9 hundred pace s to a thousand pace s if the powder  is strong and in the air half a league .

Some invented loading cannons with cartouches.

Some don't fill the canon with powder  at once but twice and each time ramming the powder  in, saying that each time you ram it, you raise it and give an inch  more. But this is not sure for big pieces for they are loaded with a lot of powder .

The bastarde  is a middle-sized piece of artillery  which weighs thirty quintal s and its cannonballs weight 15 pound s and is loaded with 10 or 12 pound s of powder . Its proportions are two cannonballs and a third part of a third one thick at the breech and one cannonballs and three parts of two at the front. They are used for fighting against less important defences such as gabions or sentries, topped with a tower, or similar thing. It is thirteen to fourteen pan  s long like the great cannon. Ten horse s are necessary to carry it. It goes with the culverine for shooting because it carries small munitions. 

Some make the breech three cannonballs thick and the front two cannonballs.

The bastarde culverine  weights 35 quintal s and is 25 pan  s long. The breech is three cannonballs thick and the front two cannonballs. Its cannonball is like the bastard one, weighing 15 pound s. These are fixed pieces which cannot be carried on a carriage. They are for city defences. Some make cannons like these which are 27 or 28 pan  s long, like La Rochelle 's vache , but such pieces are strengthened at the breech with a width of three cannonballs. Their range is one league  and a half. Its load is like the bastarde 's one, and if one wants to hit horsemen  very far way, more powder  is added. After the cannonball there is a trace of smoke which drives your trajectory to where the cannonball is going. This is understood for cannons and the culverine , but not for small pieces.

The average weights 18 quintal s  and is xii pan s  long. Its cannonball weighs eight or 9 pounds  and its load is six pounds of powder . The breech is three cannonballs thick and the front is two. It is more appropriate against cities' defence rather than in battery. It is however sometimes used either to break a barricade or to support the battery after cannons have shot, in order to prevent the assailled from rebuilding after the cannons have played and shot. Four horses  can carry it. It has a range of eight or nine hundreds paces  and almost as many as the bastarde.
  
To cannons and big pieces we give as much powder  as a cannonball and a half's diameter in proportion to the escusson . For medium pieces, such as campaign pieces, and the ones smaller, we provide them with powder the equivalent of two cannonballs have a quantity of powder  equivalent to two cannonballs thick in proportion to the passevolant  and smaller ones are given three cannonballs thick of powder . Usually, all pieces are loaded up to the escusson. We load all pieces under 4 quintal s  with the linstock , two linstock s  of cannon powder or one and a half lantern of arquebus powder. For smaller ones, we only use one linstock  . The pieces of one quintal   as loaded with a little charge.

A battlefield piece weighs ten or twelve quintal s  and is ten or 12 pan s  long. Its cannonball weights 6 or 7 pounds and its loaded is 4 pounds of powder . The breech is three cannonballs thick and the front is two, like all the pieces under the mid-sized. The breech is thicker for they are in proportion longer and also because they are more frequently used than big pieces against houses or elsewhere. Their caliber is also small, so we give their breech a thickness of three cannonballs. They are used to follow immediately a camp and for the defence of cities and houses, settling them on walls or in a tower. Three good horses  are required to carry it.

The passevolant weighs 6 quintal s  and is eight or nine pan s  long. Its cannonball weighs two pounds, and its load is a pound and a half of powder . The breech  is three cannonballs thick and the front two. Two horses  can carry it because one single horse can't carry a piece. It is used for houses' defence or to be brought amongst the infantry to break a horsemen rank.

A faulconneau  weighs 4 quintal s  and is 10 pan s  long. Its cannonball weighs a pound and a quarter, its load is half a pound of powder . The breech is three cannonballs thick and the front two. To carry it, two horses , altough  these pieces are seldom moved since they are manly used to defend houses. The ones which are carried over for battery or a fight, or a siege, are culverines, medium-sized bastardes and pieces

of campaign. Faulconneau  is to commonly loaded with a linstock . There are also some other faulconneaux  weighing three quintal s , and which are nine pan s  long. Their cannonball weighs half a pound. Their load is a quarter pound of powder . They can be loaded with a linstock , but more commonly they are loaded with a charge. The breech is three cannonballs thick and the front two. The small pieces which are under three quintal s  are at least three cannonballs and a twelfth of a cannonball thick at the breech, and the front thickness is sometimes reduced to get the proportion according to the length.

The strength of the piece is at the level of the tourillon , where the lighted powder  starts.

The strength of the berche  is at the maslée , behind the breech.


A double musket weighs 2 quintal s  and is seven pan s  long. Its cannonball is a quarter of a pound or less. The breech is three cannonballs thick, and the front two. It is loaded with as much powder  as cannonballs, to the top of the touch line, which is equivalent for such small pieces to 3 or 4 arquebus powder  cannonballs, because if canon powder  is used, it can be loaded five cannonballs high.

This has to be understood as iron  cannonballs. When a metal cannonball is fired, we overload it with a quarter of linstock   because if a cannonball weighs 40 pounds, a metal one weights 60 pounds. This is why the sight is higher when a metal cannonball is fired. Because if an iron  cannonball is fired directly, a metal cannonball is shot from six lines higher. A metal cannonball, mixed with copper  to make it more brittle, is more effective at close range than the iron  one. But an iron  one is more effective at long range. 

A simple musket weighs one quintal   and is six pan s  long. We disregard the ones that are less than two quintal s , and which usually throw lead cannonballs by its weight, and concentrate on those  which are loaded by caliber. However, those muskets  that can be loaded with metal or iron  cannonballs will work better, for they will do more damage than the lead ones . It is loaded up to the touch line, which is 4 cannonballs thick. 
 
Arquebus à croc weighs 60 pounds, the bigger one is five panel s  long, it is loaded up to the touch line, which is 4 cannonballs thick; it is loaded with lead  cannonballs, and is for house's defence. These great and small arquebuses are used for to make orgues , appropriate for an assault outside and inside.They are casted separately in order to be used in various ways.

You know how to draw a circle correctly with the quill  & or else with the nail of your right thumb   & the bent big finger  . If you do not have a ruler , fold paper  in two five or six times to use it. And if you want to draw a column, arch, oval, escutcheon correctly  without a compass , fold your paper  such that the fold e   gives you a straight line, at the required distance from which, trace a point & a  or a line & saturate it well with ink . Then fold again the paper  & rub it on the back & it will stamp however much you have made. In that way la l  , A is the line without ink  which the paper  fold gives you, B is the line you have traced, C is the one which is stamped.

@For making millas 
You must have some millet  soaked in order to remove the chaff  and then clean it well. Next you must grind  it again quite finely and pass through a cloth sieve . One must soak the flour  with fresh melted butter  and some milk  so that it is very light, like the pastry  to make beignets , and add egg yolk  depending on the amount of flour , so that there are two egg yolks  for each millas . Then you will put in some saffron   if you want to give them a little colour.
Afterwards you must have some mold s, which must be made from terracotta  , in the shape of the bottom of the catholic hat, but it must be open at both ends. And then, having made a good fire, clean where you want to put your millas  and then take your mold s and grease them very well so that the pastry  does not stick to them when baked. Once you have done that, put your mold s in a place in the oven  where you clean and sprinkle a bit of flour  on the bottom and fill them with some of the aforementioned pastry . Then you will cover the said mold s, with a lid  made like the mold , but it must be bigger and not open at the top. Then once done, you will put some straw  on the said lid  and a lot of hot charcoal , and set a fire around it, once done, you will open up one of them after a bit of time and will see when it is baked, it will be hard.

@Glazier 
Glass from Lorraine   is smoother & more even than plate glass  and it is sturdier & more durable. But commonly it is stained by veins, in straight lines as if tanned, which happens because the glassmakers , having made it, put it when totally hot on straw  , which stains it in this way. However, this is removed with varnish  & salt  & other drugs  that the  glaziers  put in. Glass from Lorraine   is sold by lien   & each lien   is composed of three tablets . The lien   costs usually x sous  . Plate glass sold in  is made in France , it is whiter & clearer, but alternately it is not so durable as that from Lorraine . It is also commonly blown & in that case, it is better to make little diamonds rather than large square pieces in the shape of the frame, because they are not able to seat themselves very evenly.
Plate glass  is sold by paniers  . Every panier   contains 24 plates  that are commonly sold at x or twelve lb .

To whiten the face 
Pound puffball   in cistern water , and no other, and wash with this whitened water . This is highly regarded. And I believe that making it from wheat  starch  and using that would be even better.

Against windiness, colic, etc.
Sap squeezed from orange  peel   or water distilled from orange  peel  is excellent against windy colics. Candied peel  is also excellent for stomach  winds. And to try it, having poured sparkling wine  in a glass , press orange  juice  on the wine's foam , which comes only from vapor and wind, and you will see that the foam will immediately disappear. Also, if you squeeze juice  against a candle it will burn brighter.


Eschervis  racine  
They want to be planted in a very humid place or such that, with water from  wells or fountains, they can be frequently watered, because this makes them tender. Otherwise a hard core forms inside, which takes away all their goodness.

Cannoneer 
As for small cannons that are not loaded with a linstock, one loads them with powder  all the way up to the touch hole, which is placed at a point on the cannon that indicates the appropriate measure.
To point a cannon, that is to say to fix the target, one needs to set the sights, in other words, take aim, from the sides rather than the top, that is to say the top of the cannon. By taking aim from the top, you can find the line of fire that leads to your target, but you will not find out if the cannon leans more to one side or the other.  Then take your sights first from one side and then from the other and adjust your cannon to point at your intended target.  Then set your sights from the top of the breech, which will be quickly done.  Next, use your discretion to lower the cannon a little if you are within firing range, because the force of the powder  blast usually raises the barrel. If you are outside of the range in which the cannon can fire in a direct line, you should consider that the weight of the cannonball will lower the barrel.

Shooting a cannon at night
Some keep their cannons loaded and in the daylight hours.  Then, so that the cannoneer  can shoot into the breach where the besieged are perhaps reparing the breach , the assailants raise a false alarm so that the besieged throw torches or artificial fire  into the moats or around the breach, light by which the cannoneer  can take aim. Sometimes by using the reflection off mirrors  or jars  full of water , the assailants can redirect the light onto the breach. The method that you know, using a sundial and lead  line, is also very good.  Others use strong iron  pegs to fix two or three planks onto a platform of wood  made to carry a battery of cannon, and leave some notches empty where the cannon wheels can pass perfectly.  And with this method you will always put the cannon in such a position so that it doesn't tilt to the right or the left.  And so that it isn't too high or low when you fire the following day, you place a marker that is well fixed in the ground, that just touches the bottom edge of the canon after it has been aimed and adjusted for firing.
If the platform, the wheels or wedge parts break or come loose, this invention holds no advantage.
 
 021v
 Others place two well-staked poles into the earth in such a way that the one is as far from the edge of the cannon's mouth as the other.  And underneath they place the above-mentioned ruler. Then when want to fire the cannon at night, they push their cannon straight towards the above-mentioned ruler and make it so that the edge of the mouth rests on the end of the aforesaid ruler. Next, they measure with a ruler, or a similar tool with measured intervals, from one pole to the side of the cannon and if it is too close or too far, they adjust the canon and make it the same distance as from the other pole.

Unspiking your cannon
Some people say that one should remove the cannonball if the cannon is loaded and introduce fire into the mouth of the cannon. But it is probable that the fire will leave again through the mouth rather than seek its exit through the touch hole which is spiked and restricted. The most reliable way is that the cannoneer , who is often a founder , drive in a nail  and turn back the point of the nail  that the enemies placed therein, and with a trephine , make another touch hole at the side of the spiked one, which can be done in an hour. And if with time the violence of the powder  loosens the nail  that the cannon was spiked with, you will make a nut in the second touchhole and place a screw  in it, so perfectly that it will never come undone.

Defense of a town
There is nothing more efficient for defending a breach than mortars placed at the front line, as soon as the initial assault. They carry a lot of ammunition and are filled with cart nails , big steel  dice, bits of chains  and similar items. And when one senses that the enemy is close, one lights everything on fire. Grenades, well-constructed and thrown at the right moment, also cause much damage. And to make them worse, one can add some roughly crushed glass , either in the mold or in the crucible, when one casts them. This worsens the wounds. The grenades must not be too brittle, but it is good that they be somewhat alloyed with the material of the grenade so that instead of breaking up, they resist shock better and inflict more violence.

 Orgues
Then they are affustés on a rather thick board close to each other and notches are made onto the board this way  . 
And through these notches is fit the harquebus’s hook which has a hole through which we pass, from under, iron  pegs. When you want to aim, you affuste the middle and side ones. If you want to make double, triple or four ranks or more, you have to put similar board rank one on the other, like the first one. This manner of making an orgue fait faute @ and makes it very stable. Because the other ones made of one massive and solid piece have cannons of only one and a half pan long. They therefore are used only for a salvo at an entrance or to protect a gate.

A small hooked harquebus a-crocke weighs 40 pounds  and is 4 pans   long, and is to be loaded to the touch hole, its breech is three cannonballs thick, its front two.

The double cannon is nothing different from the big ordinary cannon, apart from the fact that its cannonball has one line  of thickness - or of diametre - more. A line  is a twelfth part  of a cannonball. At the breech, it has a thickess of one line  more than the cannon, and the mouth is half a line  thicker. Its load is six or seven lbs  of powder , more than a cannon, that is to say of two big linstocks. Its cannonball weighs 56 lb . Thirty horses  are necessary to carry it. It weakens the walls more than a cannon. But it is very uneasy to drive. This is why it is unused today and is more appropriate to be brought to a nearby place for close combat or for a ceremonial  entry, rather than for an ordinary execution. They are called basilics, and they are unmovable pieces.

A mortar is made so that it weighs three quintals  and carries a cannonball flat on the side from which it must exit and round on the side of the cannon, as if it was a cannonball cut in half. It is two pans long. It has to be loaded with xxv lb  of powder because it has to be full to the opening and has to fire. Its bottom is not thicker than the opening and is made of one single piece. Its material has to be better than other artillery pieces, and for 4 quintals  of fine copper  there must only be one quintal of metal  so that it absorbs the shock, and so that, when fired with more force, it is more efficient. It has to be used against a door with a large iron  cross before the bullet, and once loaded, needs to be covered with a firmly sewed rough canvas  which should be completely smeared with turpentine . Four handles need to be added to it while it is cast, it is thus easier to place. The iron  cross is fixed to the opening with the canvas  covering it. The handles have to be held at its opening's edge, as you can see. To place it, you need three or four iron pegs  of one pan   long and as thick as a finger  , which have their point like a gimlet , and their body like a screw as they are strongly pulled, and a ring on the other side to turn them with a short stick  that fits into the ring . And the pegs  are fixed on the door, not straight, because they would not have any strength, but crooked as if you wanted to fix them towards the middle of the mortar , and to do the holes of the handles need to be quite large. In that way, the shooting mortar  pushes the pegs  back and forth into the door, and makes more damage. Once in place, you need to have saucisse de buckram   @ made in this manner: take eight or nine canes   of buckram   selvage or more if the gap is larger, which have to be as large as four or five fingers  , have it sewn in such a way so that it is like an intestine where a stick  as thick as a finger   can fit. Fill it completely with good

This one is to be put below an undermined tower with its opening towards the top. One casts two large iron rings  and, with a stick  or two, four men carry it. They are also used for placing within wall breaches but just half a charge is necessary, that is x lb , and fill the rest with some pebbles  and cart stones 
.


 
It needs to be covered entirely with a waxed canvas  and rubbed with turpentine  and other combustible things . This cover is made to ensure that the bullet does not fall and so that, when the cover is given fire, the powder  does not fail. Upon the fuse, you will need to put a good quantity of powder . Some put on the ball a cross of iron  which is longer than the mouth of the mortar  by two pans  . Others only put the ball.

  powder . When the sausage is filled, dip it gently in two parts vinegar  and one of spirits , to moisten the canvas  but not the powder . Next, leave the aforesaid canvas  to dry completely, and then you need to attach to the sausage a long string  or cord twice as long as the sausage , but you must not tie it to the sausage but make it touch the two ends and sew it to the sausage in a few places in the middle. Next you need to smear all of the sausage with very good turpentine , and at one end, where you will want to join to the mortar 's fuse for firing, you can sew or tightly attach with a selvage of canvas  as large as one empan   which should also be well soaked in turpentine , and this selvage should be cut in the middle so that it can be fastened and wrapped around the mortar , and you must attach it so that the tip of the sausage that is open will be joined to the fuse of the mortar . Then you need to place a lot of tightly-packed powder  onto the fuse of the mortar . And next, the person outside of the ditch should draw the small string  and cord  that is joined to the sausage so that it is extended mid-way, but not so much that it is detached. And if there is water  in the ditch, it will be necessary to support the sausage with a fork. Then, having placed himself and others in safety, the person who holds the tip of the sausage will be able to fire.

Mortars  that one wants to fix on doors or iron  gates are sufficient if they weigh 40 or 50 lb . For the rest, for its charge, cannonball, and process, you need to do all just as was already said before concerning the one of 3 quintals  . One man can carry it.

The cannonball needs to be be round on one side and flat on the other like a half  of a cut cannonball. The cross also needs to stick to the ball - the latter melting if it is made with metal  - and is enveloped in the middle of the cross.

 024r
Grenades
Grenades should be made from the finest metal you can find, for there is fine metal and rough metal. Fine metal is that of big bells, because one puts in more copper  to give them a bigger voice, and for small bells one puts more tin  to give them a clearer sound. The metal of big bells is made with 3 quintals of rosette  and twenty or xxv lb. of tin . Each grenade should weigh four to six lb. In order to throw them, they must be full of powder mixed with coarsely pounded glass. And in a quarter lb. of powder, one must put half an ounce of glass, so that on the face or places where the powder will have an effect, the wounds will be worse. The best harquebus powder is required. The hole needs to be as large as the thickness of a swan's feather, and there is no need to make it into a screw, it is enough to make it even. Then you make a pipe of well soldered fer blanc , which can enter into the hole up to the middle of the grenade and which juts out the width of one finger. You will fill it with good powder, pounded in a mortar and lightly tempered with good spirits  or strong vinegar . One does so in order to slow down the powder. And in order to know if it will be slow enough to allow time to throw the grenade without danger, try this powder thus tempered in another pipe. You can keep your loaded grenades in a very dry place, and on the contrary you should keep your pipes filled with that tempered powder tight together in a humid place. And nonetheless, you should have some already inserted into grenades, so that you are always equipped. And every 3 days you will change them if you notice they have become too dry. To throw your grenade, take it firmly in one hand and with the other hand light your pipe with a wick, and throw it swiftly amidst the troops. The grenade should have twice the thickness of a knife spine.

To bring a canon over land 

It requires a hundred roadworkers  or more to even gap tracks and others obstacles such as trees , stone  piles and similar things to make gabions on the road. Once one is close to the battlefield, the gunner  goes at night to locate the most convenient place to display the battery and if he does find one, a false alarm should be raised so the ones inside throw torches. Very often, 
you shoot as strong as possible so the assailed despising the battery do not fix it. Usually, there are not many gun-turrets or other defenses. And when a breach is made at the strongest and the cannon replaced, it will surprise the assailed. One should approach fortified towns at night, but   . The workers bring gabions and once these are displayed, some boards or plank are put behind gabions to keep the workers safe while behind, they fill the gabions with some earth  by means of their shovels. And while this is being performed, another false alarm is raised from another side. And once you have shot a cannon ball at the defense, the gabions the workers  display the boards to make a plain ground or a platform of four fingers or half a foot thick. And they are set into the earth . The platform is five or six feet larger than the cannon's wheels on each side if there is just one cannon. But if there are more, platformes are side by side. The space between the pieces is equivalent to the width of two gabions. As long as the battery lasts, gunner s sleep and eat close to a cannon. In small spaces, one does not bother to dig trenches to reach the pieces but display many high gabions and run towards them. In large places one digs trenches. There are always in trenches or behind barricades units on guard duty to defend the pieces. A small powder  container is kept containing three or four separate cags.

You have to know the French containers for the artillery.

It is good if the platform is slightly oriented upwards because the piece is more quickly put in action & tient plus coup  and hits harder.
 
Lined cannons are those with a lining in the powder container space. The bullet rolls only up to the opening of this chamber. These ones are not so efficient and are not easy to load but they do not light up so quickly.

Steel  touch-hole is to be put as an anchor in the canons so it will not be damaged during the shooting unlike the others very quickly did. But these anchors are prone to jump off and injure the canonner. The only thing is to use an appropriate touch-hole.

A touch-hole at the bottom level is the best. That way the cannon does not come backwards.

 025r
 a hundred feet away from the battery and should be surrounded with barricades or trenches. And this is where they go and get powder  in bags or baskets. And each piece has its own basket to it three or four times. Then, when the cannon is placed on the platform, one puts an arquebus bulletproof board between two gabions. Then, with a lantern, a gunner  reloads it, and with the ramer which is at the other end of the lantern, two men press as hard as they can, nine of ten pushes, until the powder  is dense Then another one adds some hay  or straw  and the others ram for a while. Another one loads the cannon ball. And the one with the hay  adds the same amount and presses again. Another one adds a wood  hung but this might damage the piece. And if one has to shoot a lot, one would need many hungs which are heavy to bring. When the cannon is loaded, xx or xxv workers  push it forward with the sticks by the side, behind the gabions without taking off the board until the cannon reaches it. Once the cannon is forward, the gunner  adjusts it with the hooks at the back, pointing at the target on each side and then in the middle.Then another one nearby sets fire. Each gunner  needs 3 cannoners : one to load, one to point at the target and one to set fire. Sometimes, against a camp where breaches are made, one shoots a cartridges, as you find elsewhere, or one may use a basket full of stones , cars' nails  or similar things. A cannon must not be carried unless it is with two wood  or iron  carriages. And you need seven quintals and a half of iron  to fill the cannon's wheels, flasques and other equipage. The best battery is, according to some people, made as a curtain which sideways, because by doing so you unsettle more stones.
---------------------------------------- 
Some add small wheels to a piece and a thick board to the end of the piece so it can be moved quicker and without noise. Others add some leather around the wheels and also add soles or leather shoes to the horses' hooves so they cannot be heard.

Gunner
There are three rings on a cannon, one at the breech, one in the middle, one at the mouth. When founders want to work on their piece or have a cannon or another lighter piece and easier to carry, they make it from the breech ring to the middle one in the same size and proportions as the bullets described below. But they taper it more or less one line on each side from the middle ring to the mouth ring, always using a compass for their measures from the straight line which they draw in the modelle en papier    whatever pattern. And this reduction is consequently equivalent to seven or eight quintals  less. And this does not make the piece less secure. This is done for big pieces, but for pieces smaller than the mid-one, one has to keep the aforesaid proportion and make the piece in one straight line from one end to the other. Usually the trunnions are situated one foot away from the middle ring in the direction of the breech. 


But since some gunners prefer a piece heavier at the front for it is easier to adjust and for that purpose, it is sufficient to place the trunnions closer to the breech and further away from the middle. On the contrary if you want to make it heavier at the bottom, you will place the trunnions 
closer to the middle of the piece or forward in direction of the mouth. When you drill your piece make a fluted cast iron  bar like a bed poster and and there must be sixteen flutes or notches in which you will fix sixteen well-even blades, so altogether they will cut and scrape similarly. Because should some not cut or scrape, there would be some waves and spaces in the cannon which would be bent and the piece might break in its middle. In order to avoid this the drill has to go evenly from the breech to the mouth and the piece's mouth must be evenly hard so the powder  will be released at once with more strength. On the contrary, if it is blocked it goes sideways and makes the piece break.

This is the right measure of the caliber, but the drill always rubs a bit more off.

They are better when shaped as the crucible with a narrow bottom and a larger mouth. You have to strongly crush the powder and add either some sand or some cork  or even better a pure pierced wax plate  because it seals well up and is more efficient.

And in this they often mix in leftovers from plates , soldering  & common tin . And to recognise the best one, it is the most lustrous, which looks burnished, because it is the softest. Sometimes in their saulmons  they find pieces of iron , stones, & similar things mixed in, to cheat on the weight. The tin from England   is so hard that the miners  put in lead  to soften it. The one that comes by way of Germany  is softer. Usually, the sworn master pewterers , from bonnes villes  , add 6 lb  of fine lead on  or  8 on a quintal  of fine tin . The others, who work in the countryside  , put fifteen or twenty or as much as they can, and to cover up the blackness of the lead they  and its softness, they put in looking-glass tin , 4 lb  per quintal , + , po   which whitens & hardens, and a little   six or eight lb  of rosette , to make the plate sonorous . 

To mold platters & dishes, they make them out of pierre porte   morte  , that is from grais  , & they shape &polish around  them on the wheel . They melt their tin  in an dest  iron  posnet  on a charcoal  fire, and with an iron  spoon  that  holds almost  a sufficient quantity for a platter, they cast leu   in their cold molds , which they keep joined & tight between their knees . And soon after, they open the molds  so that they do not heat up, & having taken out the cast which is on the female side, &  which breaks easily. Then, with a cloth  which soaks in water , which they always have beside them, they rub the middle of the back side of the dish & around the edge, so that it comes out better, and they rub the female mold with it.
+  
When the tin is fine , one adds less glass-looking tin  to it, namely 4 lb  per quintal , but if the tin is low quality , that is to say allied with a lot of lead , one puts at least five or six lb  of looking-glass tin  to it.

If there is not a lot of looking-glass tin , one puts about two or three lb  per quintal . One puts eight lb  of rosette . But if there is a lot of looking-glass tin one , like 4 or 5 lb , one only puts six of rosette . And commonly, per quintal  of tin , one adds x lb  of both.

Stucco  for molding
Take tragacanth gum  and put it to soak until, having absorbed its water , it is swollen & rendered like jelly . Then crush it quite hard on the marble   & next take rye  flour , which is better than wheat   because it is more humid and does not make the paste as brittle, and sprinkle your tragacanth gum  with it, & continue to grind and mix in  thus, little by little, le et mesler legi   the very finely sieved flour . And knead it as if you wanted to make bread , until you  you perceive that it has enough body & is as firm as bread dough  that one is ready to put in the oven . This is perceivable when it can stretch enough without breaking. And if it was not strong enough, it would not sti   release well. Thus once prepared, rub the cavity au u   with oil , with a brush , so that the oil  penetrates everywhere to make it release better, and press the paste inside quite hard. And if it does not release well, mix in more flour  until it has enough body. With this you will mold whatever work you like, masks or garlands, which will be dry within one day . Next, you will coat them with strong glue  or paste glue , as you like, and you will be able to paint and decorate them with gold  & all colors. In Rome  they make ceiling and wall ornaments with it. One can make bed ornaments with it. If you want that the work stays white , it is better to mold with plaster  instead of flour . It is true that it is more brittle and firm as well, but one needs to prepare it like this: temper it, when it is powdered strong , in a good amount of water  so that it is clear , & grind it several times a day for fifteen days . Then pour water  at an angle, and gather the plaster  & grind it finely on the marble  , & place it in some kind of clean lead  vessel , so that no dust & dirt falls into it, & leave it in the open air  & au serain   for fifteen days  with its water , and it will become matte, strong, white and light, very suitable for making a groundlayer of burnished gold . And this, when powder, you can mix, instead of flour , with tragacanth gum , and your work will be very beautiful. Lacking plaster , you can mix in well ground chalk  or ceruse , & try bole  & similar things. This stucco  with the tragacanth gum  has the quality, being malleable before being dry, of fitting on either round or flat things, as you like. It is to make an ornament at little expense.


The flour  is not good in this, but chalk  or ceruse  is.

Layer of burnished gold  on paper 
Make your ground layer of starch  soaked in water  & your gold  will burnish very well. Clear starch water  layered on the paper , then dried, & repeated in this manner 3 times, is a good layer for burnished gold  on simple paper  & has no body.

And leave it thus for a long time , because the longer it stays there , the more beautiful & better it will be & it will dissolve if it is good, otherwise it will become like lees . When you want to use it, make a small hole in the stopper of the bottle  & pour a little & stopper it again each time, then apply it on gold .
The good kind of dragon 's blood  can be found in large pieces like torteau  this one has no value and is adulterated  & once broken it shows on its edges scales, transparent as ro  rouge clair  enamel , it is also lumpy in some parts like small rubies .

They also make their molds  out of metal  which last longer & mold more cleanly than grais  , because the vessel comes out without fins & smooth. But this is for the rich  because a mold  costs fifteen or sixteen frans . They are mainly made of metal , for basins & ewers & salt cellars & similar things which are fashioned.
For pints, molds  are made with white clay  mixed with horse  dung  & cloth waste  & well beaten, because the pints, being deep half-circles, would not easily release from the grais   mould , unlike the earth  ones, which are soft. One makes the noyau  of the mold  of the said pints in grais .
In metal molds , one makes vents and casts all at once, which is the cause that in the middle of the dish, no smoky black line which comes from the vapor & smoke of the metal  that is cast, which is the cause that in that spot, the work is lumpy & very often pierced. However they repair it with soldering du n  , as is said. This smoke is made right in the middle of the cast, & in  molds of grais   .

 any dish or plate, they loosen & undo with the strike of a hammer  the iron  wedges that slide along the spokes of the wheel . And, when they are at the notch and points that they need, they tighten the said wedges, striking them with the hammer .
When their plates or dishes have been cast, soldered if needed, & recleansed of surrounding froth with the hot soldering iron  & then with a big file , they adapt it on the wheel  & first of all they wrap their desgrusoue   desgrusouer   with a rope , as thick rope    as the little finger  , & lean it firmly on the crossbar  to secure it well. And while someone else promptly turns the wheel , they guide the sharp edge of the esgrusouer   by hand  s   towards the edge of the round cavity, & gently guide it to the center of the circle. And this desgrusouer   is for removing the first rough &  lumpy skins of the work. And next they even it out with a cutting iron   called a plane  , on which they rub the sharp edge with a little putty , on leather nailed  onto a piece of wood having , and this, in such a way that the flesh or grain is on the outside, for if the sharp edge of this plane   was not thus rubbed & burnished, it would not polish & not burnish the tin , au   which would stay white, & not black & polished like a mirror. Moreover, they repair the work for the second time with this plane   as they did with the esgrusouer  . Then, with a knife  or another sharp iron  , they scrape the edges of the plates or dishes to smooth them so that they are not found sharp when handled

 Their hammers  must be quite even & polished, and if in some unfortunate case the rust, the  or some other use, has damaged them, they first polish them with emery stone powder , then they finish burnishing & smoothing with the putty .  Otherwise they would not strike neatly. It is also necessary that the face of the anvils  be the same.

The green one is made with only a pastel tincture  since green is made from yellow and blue, so the pastel  dyes the dark yellow straw . It becomes bright green. For red they use some alum  and brazil wood , for purple they use pastel  and some coperous  which darkens blue with its black tincture.

Knife to cut a nose or a finger
 This is a well-furbished knife, assembled with a nail in the middle so that it can easily swivel to one side or the other and be hidden, alternately on side A or on side B, inside its handle marked C. The two stops you see on the tips of the knife are used to block it on one side or the other against a nail which is at the butt of the aforesaid handle, so that when one wants to press hard on something in order to cut it, it does not move from the handle. You might as well allow the side marked B to cut, only not during your performance, but the side that is notched and marked A must not be sharp, it should only be furbished. And the notch must also be as wide as the edge of a knife so that it cannot hurt. And you will only show the part where the knife is not notched, for the side with the notch must be hidden inside the handle. And when you want to cut a nose or a finger, pretend to sharpen your knife on your thigh and at the same time turn it deftly, and the part with the notch, which you will cover with one finger, will come into your hand, and you will place the notch, colored with brazilwood rosette  or black cherry juice , upon the nose.

It is said that in Lorraine  and Flanders linking glass  is made of fern ashes  and pebbles . First they blow up a long still that another worker breaks off and cuts vertically with big shears. Then this long still expands by being placed on a stone or large platine in a furnace slightly colder than one for melting. Furthermore, they flatten it by rolling over  it a big and long iron stick. Then they take it out of the annealing  furnace. Similarly, they make some in England  that are quite beautiful. Close to Rouen  in France , flat glass is made with some saltworth  and pebbles  and is whiter and softer than the Lorraine  one, because it can be melted with a candle, unlike the Lorraine  one. This flat glass  is blown up in a long still -- the end of which someone else cuts and blows up whilst turning it, then flattens it using a plane which is on the ground, and then reheats it. Thus the middle of the still, where it began, always stays the same.

To sow melons properly, it must be the end of a moon cycle , because otherwise they would sprout too many leaves and not bear much fruit. Every two fingers, make small holes with a small pickaxe and, in each, put two or three seeds. Then, take very fine earth  and lightly fill the holes with it. Afterwards, spread the thickness of one thumb of 'havets,' that is wheat chaff, over everything, so that when the rain comes, it does not beat the earth and prevent their birth.

And even, if the working glass-maker  has a stink from his nose or his mouth, and he breathes on the glass , the color will not take on it. Those who came up with the invention of working in small works of softened enamels  use only azure enamel , which is blue, and esmail colombin , which is the color of purple, which they soften with rocks  or lead glass . As for yellow, they make it from silver , red from sanguine , as is said elsewhere, black and gray and shadows from scale black , either strong or weak, carnation from light sanguine . Green is made first from yellow, then they overlay azure enamel , either strong or weak, depending on whether they want to make it bright or dark.


Yellow Amber 

It is cut with a file , then one passes a certain pulverized salt  across the surface, which an Englishman  called desramonet . But I believe that this was pulverized pumice stone , for it had the harshness of arène . And with a taut cord , he polished his amber , then passed tripoli from Bretagne    on it with the finger  ; others used a piece of leather   or a cane . Amber  loses its color if an unhealthy person wears it, & becomes whitish. But to restore it, it needs to be soaked for one night   in urine , then boiled a little in it.

Sapphire 
One finds sapphires  that one calls de treille , because they are pierced and it is said that a certain king  had made from these a certain ornament in the shape of a trellis, that would be thus named the Screen of Charlemagne  in the treasure of Saint Denis , in which the gemstones  are set without leaf, so as to have the enjoyment of the light on one side & the other, &to show their naivete. I have a white one that seems to be rough & pierced, and is spotted all over with blue blemishes. I am of the opinion that these are artificial & that they are of taffre   or very clear esmail azuré   melted entirely on the sapphire . The file  bites it as on the beryl . 

Saffron  
It is imitated & cut with half dried marigold  leaves, & twisted like a thread, & placed in the hottest sun to dry, & is mixed, & the aforesaid marigold  even gives some color.

Sapphire 
Stone cutters  sometimes choose old pieces of antique glass  in church  windows, which are much thicker than those of today  & are of more lively colors. If it is for souf  sapphire , they choose beautiful blue & from such a place that there are no pieces grains , if it is possible. And having cut it in squares with emery , they cut it in bevel & polish it. And in this manner, they counterfeit very beautiful sapphires . The old esmail d’azur   for silver  verging on aquamarine was very appropriate for counterfeiting sapphires , but it is scarcely found. One counterfeits aquamarines  with white glass , but they take it from the bottom of the glass .

Amber 
The orangeish color that is in transparent amber  and in the other one that has body is not internal, for on the inside it is whitish. But through age it  or wearing it, it acquires this reddish crust. This is why those who cut it with the file  or on the wheel  do not remove, if it is possible, this crust. But they only polish it, rubbing it with a willow   stick  or other soft wood  dipped into water  & dusted with tripoli of Brittany   , and it takes a beautiful polish. If it is too straw yellow & you want to intensify its color, hang it inside a chimney  where there is much soot  & smoke , and it will take on a reddish-orange color. Try to take the most whitish transparent one, and put it under dung  to turn it green, like bones . Or smoke  it in a closed space , in the smoke of safre   or manganese  & other drugs  that you know. Or in urine  & distilled vinegar  mixed with colors, or in the vapor of aqua fortis   boiling in copper , or aqua fortis   boiling with silver  & sal ammoniac   & Some cut amber  in facets on a wheel of soft wood   with potée   instead of emery , & jet  also. The salt called de Langlois de armonic   is a mineral salt  that resembles marble stone  and is a very hard mineral with large pieces, like that of Cardona  & Monserrat .

I have experimented by making it boil in lye  or corrosive water , it turns reddish on the surface. And if it is rubbed against fir   & soft wood  before it is cooled, it is easily cut.

Black color for dyeing 
Take lye made from quicklime  and white lead , mix and leave to soak and you will have a dark brown dye, and reiterating the same you will make black. Try other colours with the lye made of lime .

Against nose bleeding and for dyeing
Pound some of the kind of  vinete  or lapathum acutum  that is red-veined, which is called dragon 's blood , and apply it on the bleeding person's forehead. This herb is a strong dye & makes beautiful violet.

Beautiful artichokes
You need to trim them every year so that only one stem is left, and water them a lot. Also plant some more every year, because the second year they will bear very beautiful fruits.

Planting trees 
It is said that rarely a tree planted on Saint Paul's day will fail to take. To cover the young shoots, oxen manure is very appropriate, for it doesn't come apart in the rain like earth.

Merchants 
Those who retail velvet and other materials do not keep double-entry books because they sell in small quantities and recording  these details would be too much effort. They only have their sales book and account books. But those who sell in bulk and those who traffic in woad have a double-entry book.

Crimson
Because one aulne costs seven or eight lb. to dye, they use cloth worth seven or eight francs. But if one wants something beautiful, one should buy some white cloth worth fifteen francs an aulne and dye it with some pure crimson woad & a little cochineal. Black fabrics are very fine because the dye is inexpensive.

Goldsmith 
They assemble silver filings  with saltpeter  which refines it & does not make it brittle. But gold filings  are assembled with borax  or, to spare the borax , with lead , which refines the gold  & softens it, for the saltpeter  would make it brittle, which silver  does not do. This is why, to save money, goldsmiths  use it to assemble, in order to spare borax , which costs viii sols   per ounce , & saltpeter  x sols   per lb .
When goldsmiths  have thus assembled their silver filings  with saltpeter , a red enamel  vitrifies at the bottom of the crucible . I do not know if the copper  mixed in with the silver  is the cause. Try for enamel  .

Dyers’ woad  
It is grown in Lauragais  where the deep soil is so fertile that every year wheat was grown there, it would lie flat for being too vigorous. This is why dyers’ woad  and wheat are grown there alternately. For cultivating dyers’ woad , the soil is ploughed with iron  shovels , as gardeners  do. Next, it is harrowed with rakes , & broken up finely as for sowing some kitchen herbs . It is commonly sown on Saint Anthony's day in January . Eight harvests are made. The first ones are better. The best dyers’ woad  of Lauragais  is the one from Carmail  & the one from Auragne . And sometimes the dyers’ woad  is good in one field & in the one close by it will hardly have worth. The goodness of the dyers’ woad  can be recognized when put in the mouth it gives the taste of vinegar , or when crumbling & breaking it, it has some mold-like veins which are as it were golden or silver. It is assayed in the dyers ' vat , and to fill a vat  with it, six bales  of it are needed. There several flocks of wool  are dyed, and if it dyes fifteen times, it is said to be worth 15 florins , if it gives xx dyings, xx florins . The good kind dyes up to 30 times & commonly up to xxv or 26.

Enamel 
Enamel  takes more readily on copper  than on silver . It is true that the cut needs to be well hollowed out & rough. Azure  in body & the red called gules, white enamel  & thick green take to it very well. Having enamelled , one gilds the feuillages  of the engraving   . Copper  has a similar hardness for engraving as fine silver  or pistolet  gold  .

Colors for illumination on glass 
In order that your turpentine  colors shall not spread, & hold together, mix in a little of tear of mastic  together with the turpentine .

Tracing some history on glass 
If you want to trace some history in intaglio on glass , you can do it in different ways. Lay your glass pane on , the thinnest you can find, on the printed history, & having cleaned the glass  well with lye  & ash  so that it is not greasy, trace over the lines visible to you with noir à huile   or noir d’escaille   with the pinceau  , if you want to paint with colors in the manner of glaziers , who wash their glass pane  with noir d’escaille   & then scrape & clear the parts which they want to coat with color, leaving that which is necessary for shading. But if you want to make gilt  histories on glass  with a background of colors, which imitates the basse-taille  of goldsmiths , gild  your entire glass pane  with gum water  or garlic  juice  or fig-tree  milk . Then moisten your printed history between two wet linen  cloths   & lay it down on the gilt glass . Then with a pin  mounted on the end of a small stick , follow the lines of your history as if you wanted to pounce it, & thus you shall exactly trace it on the gilding of the glass . & next you shall clear the background & that which needs to be blank with a quite pointy steel  awl , & and neatly follow once more the lines & accomplish your work & fashion your faces & flesh tones in pounded silver ; then you shall fill the background with azur d’esmail   or verdigris  or fine laque platte  platte   tempered with clear turpentine , mixed with a little of tear of mastic  if you want that the colors hold together more & not to spread. Next, layer on the back of the glass  & over the colors a white tin  sheet. And once this is dry, you can cover the tin  sheet of  with color to hide your secret. The tin  sheet gives light to the colors. Thus you will be able to paint without being

 being at all expert in painting. If your glass  pane is bulging as if taken from the belly of a jar, it will show better. When you apply your turpentine  colors to your glass  panes, first place them on a hot tile &, once they are hot, spread your colors & leave it a while on the tile, then lay down your tin  sheet.

Dye
Some take the root of Lapathium acutum maius  , which looks like monk ’s-rhubarb  or sorrel , & using the root, which is yellow in summer, they dye threads & similar things.

Aqua fortis  
Some put on  for four pounds of aqua fortis   matter four  that is in the retort , four ounces of common water  in the container, which is better than putting it into the retort . The alum  is de-phlegmed & calcined such that the water  does not have as many dregs. Many make it without de-phlegming the alum .

Vinegar 
One takes for granted that jec   heat red-hot the mineral salt  that looks like marble  & that is called in Catalonia  & at the border of Spain Cardona  salt , & throwing it in the  red hot or quite hot in wine , it turns it into very good vinegar . Some make it with water  poured on pomace soured after being pressed by grape pickers , but it will not keep & spoils in heat & thunder storms.

Silver gilt  buttons
Because silver gilt  does not fear fire, it is cut into lozenges flat   on one side, then they are joined together in a star shape with a paste of crushed enamel , which is then melted & the enamel  is gilt with gold  leaf and then reheated.

Grottos

Cross of the commanders of Malta  
This beautiful rouge clair   which makes the field of the white enamel  cross is blood  of fine tear of dragon 's blood  tempered with eau de vie   or else Indian  laque plate , which in my opinion is made in Flanders , tempered with clear turpentine  & tear of mastic  & laid down on a silver  leaf, not the kind which the painters  use, but a thicker kind, which is burnished by those who make foil backings for gemstones Av   or by goldsmiths , & that gives it this beautiful brilliance.

Latten  and calamine 
Founders  do not melt latten  in a air bellow  furnace  but in crucibles , for in a bellow  furnace  & amid the charcoals , the calamine  would disappear. A 

Metal 
Tin  should be pure for if there is any lead , it will go up in smoke while melting. Mixed tin  holds in the fire for a long time but the cendrée    separates it.

Aqua fortis 
If your retort is well luted you should not surround it with ashes , which would only prevent the vapors from escaping properly. But when, towards the end, you fire it intensely, surround it with charcoals  lit elsewhere beforehand, such as those in the furnace should be, so they do not crackle or smoke. Place said lit charcoals  around the body of the retort, not close to the neck, which does not need to be heated as much. The top grate, on which you place your retort, should be sufficiently far, one dour  or half a foot, from the bottom grate where the charcoal  is placed, since thus you will not waste as much aqua fortis .

Earth for casting, for founders  
It renders itself fat once beaten and also mixed with horse  dung . Potter 's earth  would be too fat and would crack & would not hold in the fire, but one needs to mix it with half the quantity  of sand and a quarter  or a fifth  of horse   dung . And leave it to dry, then powder it, then sift  it to render it fine & cleansed, which would prevent it from casting neatly. The dung  renders the earth  more amenable & easier to deal with, but it is necessary that it be well free of straw  & other things. And when the earth  is very fat, one needs to give it more sand  & more dung . But one does find fat varieties of earth , themselves mixed with sand. If they are not, make them so artificially. One always needs to reheat the earths  before casting.

Garden lily
If it is broken during its first blossom, it will not grow or bloom until the following year, and I believe it is the same for bulbous flowers in general .

Sand
The sand chosen cast  for casting should be neither so lean that it has no stickiness, nor too fat. And even if it is found in nature  , however, it is not everywhere. And if you are in a place where it is not found, you can make it, but not with fat earth , for the sand does not want any of that, for it makes it very porous. But you can make it bindable with brick well ground  on marble  , or plaster  or calcinated alabaster  or something similar, or the burned marrow of ox  horn  or burned asphalt . If you grind it quite finely on porphyry  , it s   acquires stickiness better & then you can burn it with asphalt  or mix it with a quarter part  of tripoli . Guard against bread  falling into your sand because it makes it very porous.

Try mixing in soot black .

Iron scale  taken from bars that have been in the fire for a long time , & which  is thick, is much better than the common delicate kind that falls under the anvil  in the forge , because it imitates niello . To said black , described elsewhere, some add d   a little minium  to it.


Sheared ewes 
If the shearer  wounds them at some point, he applies the very excrement of the ewe on it. When they are fat, they are easier to shear and do not get hurt as easily.


If the shearer  wants to 'viscorter' them, that is to castrate them as they  are one or two years old, he must not have been with his wife, because this would cause the sheep  to die.


Colors and gilding  on glass 
One ought not to give as strong gum water  on glass  for the gold  layer as for silver  layer as for the gold  layer because a silver  leaf is twice as strong as a gold  leaf. Also, silver  is harder and therefore does not scratch as easily. Q   And if the gum  was not a little strong for the silver , the latter would not crack so neatly. When you work, the humid  the exhalation of your breath  moistens the leaf layered on the glass , & therefore it would be good, while working, to heat it up a few times. You need to be very careful to wash that which you want to be blank & serve as a background for painting with colors, for if it were not quite clean of the gum 's greasiness  & viscosity, the  & of other things, the colors would not be so brisk on it. To advance your works, you can ponce , or, better still, layer the gum  & leaf on a cut paper . In this way, you will need to repair very little. If you want to make gold  color there without gold , mix soaked dried saffron  with a little massicot .

Wax  for seal and imprint
For the large wax  seals, one needs to have tepid water  always ready & apre   to keep your wax  in it. But before, it should have been kneaded between your hands  to render it very even, for otherwise the water  that would get in between would prevent it from coming together. Next you will imprint whatever you want and put three or four pieces of paper  on, & with a stick you  even & round like a pestle , you will roll it as if you wanted to polish it, and it will attach itself to the paper , which will help you lift it off the mold . Thus you will imprint better than if you dripped it molten. You can carve the figures & gild them, silver them, & paint them with colors in varnish , & transfer them onto a base of glass  painted with colors in turpentine & mastic . And if you want to apply these plates by inlaying, do it with gum ammoniac   mixed with vinegar , and you will have good glue .

Casting in plaster 
Melt some wax , & with a large brush , coat the relief of which you want to have the cavity, as if you wanted to paint it. And a light crust upon which qu   will be formed, upon which you will cast you plaster , to give it body and strength. Next, in the wax  cavity, you will also cast your plaster  in order to have your relief, & it will come out very easily, thanks to the wax .

Arquebusier 
To shoot your arquebus precisely the end of the breech must come precisely on the edge of the light, because like this the powder  catches fire  and burns all at once without blowing and has more strength and does not recoil. On the contrary, if the breech is made hollow, as they commonly are, the powder  catches more quickly in this place, makes it recoil, and blows. This is clearly shown by  a arquebus with a chamber which recoils more than another. And since the cannon is bigger at the breech than at the muzzle the sights are also uneven, because that at the breech is higher than that at the muzzle. Additionally, the thickness of the cannon is greater than the caliber by about one line, and the sight by another. It would therefore be necessary to either make the cannon all of one size or to raise the barrel from the end and towards the muzzle, and push it in and lower towards the breech. The weight of the powder  must be one third of the weight of the  bullet. 


Hail shot for the arquebus

Loading a pellet  arquebus
 It is necessary to make a wooden  pipe 4 or 5 fingers wide that is perfectly hollow, according to the open end of your barrel, of the form represented in A. Then, having cut some paper , which has to be as strong as that of large printed books, in the form indicated in D and as wide as you want your cartridge to be long, wrap the paper  around the baton B and at the top, where the pointed tip F will be around the aforementioned paper , and the cartridge will be formed. But, in order to make the bottom more uniform, put it into pipe A, then introduce baton B and, in the other end of the pipe, which is marked G, insert baton C and pack so as to compact and press the folded tip of your cartridge, then take it out, and the charge in this, put three or four drageons or larmes. Then, with a punch, marked E, of the same caliber of your arquebus or pistol, punch round pieces on cardboard  or felt  or waxed cloth , and put this round piece into your cartridge, and push it until the drageons with the baton B, the more drageons, 3 or 4, then a round piece. And continue like that until the cartridge is full, the put it into the arquebus. If you want your pellet to scatter earlier, make round pieces out of paper . If you want it to reach further without scattering, make the piece out of cardboard . If you want it to reach even further, make the round piece out of waxed cloth , or either of leather  or felt , and a piece of waxed cloth  on the top. And if you make the cartridge in part with waxed cloth  or waxed paper , it will reach one hundred paces and will make a big hole, and the pellet , barely scattering, will produce a big opening. But if you make your cartridge with waxed cloth  or a material stronger than paper , it cannot be so long, with the cardboard  tip being like in D, because it is enough if it wrapped around twice. In such a way, the pellet  barely scatters and makes a big hole in porte-corps armor or others.

Loading an arquebus
You must have different charges depending to the range that you want your arquebus to have, all of which have a screw on the end that fits in the nut of the the said arquebus' ramrod. So when you put the powder in the charge, which is in the nut, hold the ramrod upright. And raising your arquebus up, insert the said ramrod until the charge is in the bottom of the arquebus, then straighten the arquebus, the mouth of the barrel up, and remove the ramrod. That way, your powder will now be entirely in the breech without any grain or dust that lines the sides of the arquebus, which always has some grime in the chamber. That way it will not recoil, and you will shoot more true.

Melting
Some, to make it run neatly, put half metal  & half copper . Others take one part  of potin  & one part  of copper  latten . Others take one part  of candlesticks latten  & one part  of basin latten . And among basins, the latten  of larger ones is more brittle than that of skillets, because in order to make the round shape so small it is necessary that the substance be softer. For big ones, that have a more ample round shape, the substance can be more brittle. In any event, the most brittle latten  runs better, & casts more neatly, but it must be cast very neat  hot. One  When one wants to cast, one casts lead  into the substance, which makes it flow & run & goes up in smoke, & keeps the mold  from corrupting. And if you want to cast pieces de foeu , mix in more rosette  than latten , so that it is less breakable. The crucibles for melting metal   should be better than those for glassmakers   for glass  is not as heavy as metal . And in this instance, one needs to lute the crucibles  with earth  and crushed glass .

Regulus extracts
Take one pound of antimony , half a pound of black soap,  and half a pound of Montpellier tartar . Once it is all pulverized, you have to boil it in a varnished earthenware pot  on a big fire  as you stir it with a piece of wood or iron . The soap  will burn off and be consumed by the fire  and the rest will stay red. The quantity has to be reduced to a third. Then throw that on a tile  and it will turn blackish. You will have to melt and pour that on a tile  four or five times and then you will have regulin from antimony .
Others pulverise the antimony  and mix it with equal quantities of saltpeter  and powdered tartar  and heat a pot  or crucible  until it is red hot, then add a little bit at a time, turning their back for fear of the smoke, and keep doing so until everything is added. They maintain the fire  until everything is completely melted and melt that several times.

Lead , tin 
They become brittle having been put back to melt, often or for a long time, and they thicken and burn, in such a way that even when one melts a saulmon , the tin  thickens at the bottom if, while casting, one does not stir it often. It is best for casting to melt a little lead & the  or tin  & remuer   to renew at each melting. The antimony  renders them breakable. The looking glass tin  whitens them. One Pewterers  put in on the fine tin   one lb  of looking glass tin  per one quintal  of fine tin  & two lb  & a half or three lb  of red & soft copper of cauldrons , which is better than latten.  There is fine & soft tin  & brittle tin . The brittle one is cast in grille   by the pewterers  to sell it better. O   They come out better & more neatly in stone  moulds  than in a copper  mold , because copper  is fat & sticks unless one heats the mold  well or one casts large works. Three quarters  of lead  per one lb  of soft tin , makes a very liquid line & proper for casting, which has a shine like a mirror. Tallow for glass  lightens them. All things that lightens well metals  & remove their thickness & dense nature & render them like  liquid like water , render them proper for casting, for it is the thickness that prevents them from running. Soft tin  is more even com   than the brittle one , which is whiter and seems to be burnished like a mirror.

To alloy well tin  & lead , one needs to melt one by itself, and then mix in the other, small pieces at a time, and throw it often on the marble   or the square tile  . And when you will see it become well even like  & shiny as if it were burnished, it is good. Because sometimes it becomes spotted due to too much lead  &  sometimes due to too much tin . There is some tin  that has more lead  than others. Common tin  is the one that is mixed with lead .

One needs to cast it rather hot, for otherwise, it would not flow. Others smoke their molds  with a resin candle  to cast neatly. The antimony  makes the substance brittle & breakable. The looking-glass tin  makes the work whiter, but not more runny, as for tin , it is good to the  with pure lead . Those who make very neat lead  casts, use bodkins . Pewterers  cast in a copper  mold . One says that one makes the lead  stick on the glass  with resin . Others put into the lead  a quarter  of tin . Looking glass tin   renders the work stronger.

Pewterers 
They put into one quintal  of fine tin  one lb  of looking glass tin , which renders the tin  thicker. There are two kinds of tin , one of them, nearly like lead , which runs better, the other, brittle, which renders itself thicker. They cast in solid tin  molds  & thick or, to do it more neatly in copper  molds engraved with a burin , or in stone  or in earth  .

Birds 
Calandra larks  and all birds  taken from the nest and which have not known freedom are better, because those taken with a net never sing as well. However, wild birds  give much pleasure with their chanting, but they must be taken before Michaelmas, otherwise they do not live long. All get a small impostume on the fork of their tail, sometimes, which some call "gaillardise", which makes them sick and sometimes kills them, especially calandra larks . One can tell when they are sad and do not sing. It must be pierced, not with a pin, but very delicately by turning with the tip of a quite sharp feather . The calandra lark  should not be without river sand , and grey sand, a little rough, is the best. It rubs itself against it and purges itself with it .


Grain of lead 
Take a pierced playing card , pierced with a pin  or needle , folded on all four sides. Hold it with the end of a small split stick  and, holding the said stick  by theun bout  other  end, put your card  three or 4 fingers   away from the water  that you will have put in a dish  or similar vessel . Then pour your lead , which should not be too hot, into the card  & continually tap on the stick  that holds it. And thus your lead  will turn into round grains. And pass it through a large sieve  to separate the largest grain from the smallest. The larger one will reach 25 to 30 paces .

Those that are caught at Michaelmas are good to keep, but those that are caught in March die, because they are starting to fall in love.

Then, when one wants to fatten them to sell, one gives them millet . They sing at night. They must be caught after mid-July and before Michaelmas, because after the period when they have their young in this country, they leave as turtledoves  do. Siskins  should also be caught after All Saints' Day and before Christmas, because afterwards they leave for the mountains to brood.

Preserving fruit for the entire year
Take a rounded glass  phial, with a large enough opening to receive cherries and plums and whatever fruit you want.  Put in some hot water and leave it  for two hours, and once your water  is cold, throw it out and turn the phial upside down onto its opening on a perfectly even table and in a room where there is not a bit of draft or wind. Then prepare a stopper of fresh wax , wrapped in oilcloth , and adapt it precisely to the glass  phial so that it will be ready to stop it once you have put in the fruit.  And once you have hand-picked the fruit, only the non-rotten fruit, and on a warm and dry day, withdraw to the room, well closed so that no wind or draft can get in, and put it gently and deftly in the bottle. Then stop the bottle well with the stopper and lute it, making your lute, if you want, with some quicklime  and oil , so that no water  gets in. Then put your bottles into a tub full of water , in a cellar, during the summer, and in the winter put your bottles into a basket filled with some weights and lower it to the bottom of a deep well. Because in the winter the water  in the tub would be too cold if your cellar is not warm enough, because the water  needs to be like river water .

Molding
If you want to promptly mold something in demy relief  that comes to hand, fold some paper   in five or six doubles, & place it on the medal  & make sure the paper   is folded on the back of the medal  so that it is well secured. Next take a stick , broad at one end & pointed at the other, well softened and rub well on the paper  , &with the point of the stick  retrace the lines &  proceed until you recognize that your impression is well done. Then, at your convenience, slightly rub oil  with a pinceau  lemp   on the >paper   impression and cast in tallow  or wax  or sulphur , & the paper  , without it burning, will render your design neat, so that you will be able to mold it later in plaster  or tripoli , and then in lead  & other metal .
Polished cardboard   of little thickness & a little moistened is proper. Then if you want, strengthen it with papier collé    on the back.

Little Birds 
Buntings  sing during the night if they are left in the cool open air, but they are better suited to fattening for fine tables than for singing. Chaffinches  are prone to blindness, and their eyes swell at the beginning of August. Goldfinches  love lettuce seeds , and you can catch them in gardens on seedy lettuce using two lime-twigs . But because such a daily fayre would be too expensive for them, they are usually fed with hemp-seed . The owsell  is purged with a spider , which you must give it once a week, so that it doesn't become too strong. The lark  is purged with dry mortar , composed of lime  and sand, to keep it from becoming too strong and fat. Small young birds are purged with the same dry mortar , by placing small lumps of it in their cages. The cuckoo  lays its eggs in the nest of the bunting , otherwise know as verdaule . This bird is very simple-minded, I have previously let two go, which after a few days returned to their cage. To feed young goldfinches , it is necessary to crush almonds  with very fine breadcrumbs , and lettuce seeds  or hemp seeds . For linnets , some rapeseed .

Hot-worked steel  and files
The steel  that blacksmiths  and other iron  workers  commonly use is not refined like that from Germany  or Biscay , which is hardened in a molten iron  bath, but among the iron  in bars which is transported by flatboat from the forges of Foix  and elsewhere, some is harder, whiter and more refined than the rest, as it comes from the mine. And the workers  choose it and use it like the other steel . And because it consists of common iron , they call it strong iron . But it is not of such good quality as purified steel  like that from Germany  and Biscaye , which is sold in small beads. Some hot-work their steel , giving it a heating and then dipping it into a large quantity of water , then forging it. And fine steel , which is brittle, does break and crumble, whereas iron  can be pulled out.  Thus they separate the finest steel , which with another heating they make into a mass. The Germans  make their files from strong iron .
Steel  is applied to tools not on both sides, but underneath the part where one sharpens and whets them, and this part must be made of very soft iron .
Levantines  refine our own steel  because their country provides them with none, and they reheat it in a pot with bitumen  etc.

Copying off patterns
Make some soap water  and with it, rub and moisten the engraved stone  that you want to transfer the pattern from, then lay a white sheet of paper  on it and rub strongly against it with a sharp piece or the bottom of a glass  bottle and you will transfer your stamped piece. It is true that it will be on the left side, but if you apply aspic  or turpentine oil  on your paper , it will be stamped on the right on the other side. Then trace these lines with a paint brush or a quill, then heat the paper  and the oil  will evaporate and it will leave your paper  white. And if you don't want that to be known if, by chance, you borrowed the cut stone , soak the paper  and the polishing that the polisher  made on the back side, which distinguishes what has been made, will not be recognizable. The soap water  will turn the piece yellow, but well gummed wate r, which has the same effect, does not do this. If you want to, for the same effect, make gummed wate r then, dissolve some soap  in it and do as is said.

Cutters of printing plates
To clean the copper  plates or to have used ones print better, boil them for four or five hours in a good detergent  with quite used laundry water . Then make your ink  with some linseed oil  instead of walnut oil  and press with the rollers. The copper  plates are ready sooner than the wood  ones, but they are not so clean to print promptly. The wood  ones are tedious but would have sooner printed twenty sheets against two sheets  of the other. To print with wood , the secret is firstly to poach, that is to say to lay the transferred pattern or drawn piece down on the wood  plank and to make sure that the drawn side is stuck to the wood . Once dry, you will gently rub with a moist handkerchief  the reverse side of the paper  which, by being rubbed, will become so fine that what will remain will almost only be the drawn part, which, after, one should trace while cutting the pattern. You could do that to ornamented glass  and glass  layered with black  cut pieces, to then scrape and layer your colors  on the uncovered side . To make ink  for copper  plates

These rollers are good for printing promptly with thick sheets of paper  cut in different kinds of pastes.

One can place the plates among the linens when the detergent  is rather fine, or also in a pot.

 which is different from the printers' one, you have to boil for a long time some walnut oil  or, even better, some linseed oil , and after boiling for a long time, you will add garlic  cloves and bread  crusts to skim them and leave again to boil on big fire, then eventually you will add a measure of lampblack  that you would have ground with some oil  previously on the marble . And lastly you will mix everything and until you see that the plate prints well. And when you will have spread the ink , dry the plate with a white sheet of paper  and do that until the paper  looks clean and then print. If you dry the plates with a cloth , it would remove the ink  off. Linseed oil  gets thicker while boiling and becomes similar to a varnish and risks catching fire as soon as you boil it, so make sure that when you boil it, it is in an open space or where the flame cannot damage anything. Some burn some scale  until it turns black and grind it with some non-boiled linseed oil  or walnut oil  that some consider to be better. This black is beautiful but the lamp smoke  one is blacker. When you want to print, take with your finger's end and reasonably spread some of the said black  all over the plate previously cleaned with some detergent  as said, then, rub it with a white sheet of paper  until the paper is completely white and do not touch it with your bare hand but with a paper  applied on it. And after cleaning the plate perfectly, rub again the sides and edges with a folded sheet of paper . Then, have available  a small even table and on it a piece of felt , then a few sheets of paper  and eventually the one you want to print on, moistened between two humid napkins . And on this sheet of paper , put your sheet then some more paper , and at least another piece of felt . Then put it through the rollers and you can print a dozen pieces consecutively while always charging the plate with ink  and cleaning it as you did. But if you stop printing, the rest of the ink  will dry out in the plate's lines and so you will have to let it boil in detergent  or urine , as said, to clean it. The rollers must not be too loose.

The Work done in Algiers
Have a colt  of three of four years and feed it on barley  and straw  cut in the same way as that which they use to feed horses in Spain . Let it drink water  from a good fountain or river water  . I do not know if it would be good sometimes to let him drink the water  of sulfur  springs, and to sometimes give him fenugreek  or other hot foods, for the intention of the worker  is to use the heat of his manure , and the climate here is cooler than that of Algiers. Keep it in a warm place and use it and make sure it loses none of its manure  or urine , of which you will make a mass or two so that while one cools the other will keep its heat and be suitable to continue. Also have a large flask as thick as possible, one finger thick if it can be so made, and with a capacity of one pitcher or clay  jug, and around the feast of St John place a dozen and a half chicken eggs , that is to say, the egg  without the egg  white  and the germ . Others say sixty yolks . And with this dozen and a half of chicken egg yolks  put one half ounce (others say sixty eggs  and a half pound) of female silk worm eggs . And after carefully luting the flask (I do not know if air will be needed for the generation) and bury it in the heat of the manure  up to the neck, and leave it there until several worms  are engendered and then remove the flask and do not bury it in the manure  anymore. But put it on the hot layer of the manure  until all the worms  are eaten and consume one another by shriveling and stirring, and only one remains. Once this has happened, you must lure it at regular intervals, day and night, with the assistance of two men, who will care for it in shifts, and you will lure it with an egg yolk  covered in gold  leaf or with a liquid yolk  into which the gold  leaf has been incorporated. And be careful that it does not miss such fodder (some say one egg yolk  per hour, others say three, but the thing itself will demonstrate the practice). So nourished in this way it will grow in two month or seven weeks and will become like a serpent , one span and four fingers long, and one pound in weight, and as the wings will begin to develop, you must kill it, doing so with a charcoal  fire in a ring around the bottle one span away from it, and at that time lute the bottle well so that it does not exhale.

 or to be safer, go away until the fire is completely blown out and that everything is cold again. Because the exaltation may be dangerous. And for that moment, when you take it with some tongs, do cover your mouth with some good vinegar  and have a protection and cover yourself with it. Once it has died out, put it into a cloth or a canvas made of silk  and fold it and hold it to a board exposed to air and the sun will dry it. Once it is well dry, powder it in a mortar and keep  this powder cautiously Because one ounce of this one thrown on 3 pounds of melted ♁  transforms it into a finer ☉  than the other one. But there is not so much pitch. You also have to choose the oldest ♁  possible which has often melted before and finely hammered into blades or other works, and at first purify it by melting and throwing it into some honey  and vinegar . The completion time for such work is nine months from Saint John's day until the 25th April. 

Linseed 
If one wants to have it strong and very fine, one has to gather it before the seed is completely ripe. Because if you wait for the seed to be completely ripe, the base is so dried by the sun that it is brittle and hard.It is true that like this, the seed reduces by a third.

Colors
If you want to keep them beautiful in gum  and such that they do not lose any of their natural color, put white wine , the whitest and clearest you can, in a bottle  with a little tragacanth gum . And having stoppered  the bottle , scramble & shake it very strongly together, & let it rest until the tragacanth  is dissolved. Also put in a little fine-grained sel blanc   to brighten the whole. Some mix clear water  with white wine , and with this mixture they temper the colors without grinding. And these show very beautifully on illumination  works.

Soldering a vise
It is good that the jaws of the vise should be high for use in making a long piece, and that they join well to clamp a thin object. In order to solder the nut, after you have made the bolt, you will make a long iron  strip of the right thickness to fit into the notch of the bolt when red hot, and you will bend it all around the bolt  by striking it with a hammer. Once it is well wrapped around, you will insert the bolt around which the nut is wrapped.

Copper 
If, in the fire &melting, it touches the iron , this iron  will be afterwards so brittle that it will be able to be forged.

Lead  casting
One mixes it, according to some, with half tin  & half lead  and, to heat    it, one mixes in a little sublimate . It casts well in small sizes in a cuttlefish  bone  , provided it is good.

Paper  molding
Boil over hot ashes   some cotton  in aqua fortis   mixed with sal ammoniac , like aqua regia  , and the cotton  will become very fine, like powder. Mix it next it with gummed water  & you will cast very delicately.

Almond trees, apricot trees
They grow quite straight if they are grafted. And every kind of tree whose fruit has  pits, such as nectarines, peaches, clingstone-peaches, apricots etc., comes best by shield budding on an almond tree by.

Lead  and copper  casting
Lead  & tin  come out well in white chalk  but the softer it is the better. The one from Champaigne  reaches the price that is fixed in Lyon . Burnt & calcined horse  bones  mold very neatly.

I believe that the marrow from the horns of oxen   or sheep  , that is to say, the spongy bone  from the inside, molds very neatly and is better than bone .

Note that all brittle metal comes out better than fat  ones. Also, lean sand  receives it better & absorbs it rather than the dense one .

Silkworms 
They are produced from grain, that is eggs, which are sold by the ounce, which is commonly sold in Languedoc 3 lb. and 5 s. The one from Spain brought by merchants is considered to be the best, because the worms coming from it are not so subject to illnesses and produce more silk. In Spain, one ounce of grain gives worms that commonly make 15 lb. of silk. But from one once produced in France, they do not make but 10 or 12. Three ounces of grain are to produce such a quantity of worms, with which you will be able to furnish a room with three or 4 shelves of wide boards. They begin to shed their skin on their own around Easter. And to do this, one has to put them in a pine box, like the ones in which we put pellet, warmly among feather cushions. And in the beginning, they shed their skin as little black ants, and as soon as there are two or three without skin, they have to be given white mulberry leaves. And then arrange them on the boards. And three times per day, it is necessary to change the leaves for fresh ones. And if during the day there is any storm or rainy weather, cloudy and cool, one needs to keep in the room three or 4 embers and with glowing coal, and to light incense until the room is filled with its smoke. And when the weather is warm and serene, they produce more and better silk. Some worms make it whiter, others more yellowish. And even if it is white, it can be yellowed when it is extracted with hot water. From their birth until the moment they make their cocoons and prisons, worms sleep and rest 4 times, and each time they remain 4 or five days resting without eating, as if they were dying so as to be born again, because each one sheds their skin and begins by uncovering the head, then consequently, on different days, the rest of the body, and they go from white to grey, and from grey to white. And if one of them has some sickness and does not have the strength to shed, one needs to help it and to be careful not to squash it, because if it gives off a yellow liquor, it is no longer worth anything. And they do not even serve much if one handles them. Around Pentecost, they begin to want to climb on the dry heather branches that we prepare and attach

See Marco Girolamo Vida, Bishop of Alba and Cremonesi, wrote a poem on the nature of silkworms.

 to some of the upper boards, and one can tell when they want to climb up when, on the leaf, they stretch out and raise their heads and a part of their bodies when one takes them to heather branches where they stop and begin to spin their prison, which we call cocoon, generally the size of a pigeon egg, although there are some which are much bigger because it sometimes happens that two or three and up to 11 worms  put themselves in a cocoon, which is hairy and cottony, around which ball is filoselle or floret, and of the cocoon, which is a white, solid, continuous and firm skin, silk  is made. The cocoon is so hard that it is cut with difficulty with a fingernail. And yet to leave its prison, the worm  eats away at it on one end, and after having stayed inside, living on its own juices for three weeks, it comes out, reduced in size by half. Because when it begins to spin, it is as long as a ring finger and has eight legs, and when it comes out it is less than half as long and only has four legs. On the other hand, it has become a butterfly and has wings; however, it does not fly. There are males and females. As soon as they come out of the cocoon, the male mates with the female, and they are put on a piece of white linen where they lay their eggs, which will not be good and viable if the male was not given to her. When the male has detached himself from a female, one must get rid of it because it would not be good to give it to another female. They finish spinning and laying eggs in three weeks and around Saint John's Day. And then one keeps their eggs and grain until Holy Week, as mentioned. Some worms  spin among the leaves and make their cocoons there without climbing high.

Warm up the barrel and close the lumiere d'embas, and take a piece of the freshest pork suint  that you can find and as long as the phalanx of your little finger and the size of the diameter of the canon, and push it back and forth until it is completely melted. Then, load a cartridge which fits on the top of the barrel, as you know, and it will only make a little whistling.

Dipping for a bullet that will reach far away and will compromise the healing
Mix some suint  and strong vinegar  and dip the bullet in this mixture while it is still hot.

Against wounds
Hurt a chicken  or a dog  to test  and put some sap  and ground herb which is called sempervina  on the wound. It is the one with the leaves like small grains that some call vernicularis . It well-known that it will not die.

To know one's course in open sea
Soak a piece of cloth  in oil , then attach it to the poop of the boat so that it is dipped in the water, and it will make a trail that will be visible for ten leagues since the water  parts wherever the oil  has passed.

For casting
Chalk  most recently taken from the quarry  is good for lead . One ought not grind wet, but rather grind finely while pestling or scraping through a sieve . Thus for pumice , which one ought not grind with water , nor corrupt its natural state. Lead  should be slightly mixed with tin , in order only to give it strength, and two parts oftin for  of lead  for of  one of tin  or more.

Excellent temper for breastplates
 Have the clearest and the most running river water  you can, and heat it up slightly more than warm. Then have a bunch of reseda,  take its seeds and dip them into the said water  and bring it to a rolling boil it while stirring it with a stick . Then pour it into a muid or any other vessel, then throw into it two pecks of salt . 
Then take a big cauldron full of the said river water  and heat it up slightly more than warm. Take three or four times the quantity of red greasy earth  you can hold in two cupped hands, dip it and throw it into the cauldron filled with the said water . Have as much pigeon manure  as of the said earth , as much horse manure  and as much iron scrapings . And mix each of these separately, throw into the caldron and leave for two or three days. Then throw it into the said muid and stir all strongly altogether. And the older this temper is, the better it will work.

Varnish  for distemper 
You can make marble  by distemper  from lake  or rose of Ghent   & chalk . Once dry, glaze with lake  mixed in wine , for the glue  makes it die & blacken. And all will then appear red, but the varnish  you will put here, which will penetrate, will make dark & light parts appear as they ought to be. The varnish  is made thus, mix with clear Venice  turpentine  some spike lavender  oil &  until all is clear & liquid enough, &it is done without fire. This one es   is for things in distemper , and the turpentine varnish  that you know, for panels. Pure spike lavender  oil varnish  is not good for panels, for spike lavender  oil  is too penetrating & makes colours sparkle, unless it was made long ago.

The lake  & floree  rosette of Ghent   & others lose their color & die in the air.
All marble   on which a knife  can prick is worth nothing for grinding fine colors.
Chalk  has no body in oil . Ceruse  is appropriate. But lead white  more excellent. Ceruse  is the whitest, when ground first in water , the lead white  grayish. But the white  it takes on its perfect whiteness in oil .
When you grind your colors, first clean your workshop  well, for when walking, if you stir up dust, this will damage your colors, which will never be beautiful if they are not very be   clean.
Florey  must not be mixed with azur d'esmail   or another, for it makes it green.
For palettes  to paint, ivory  is excellent, knots of the fir tree  , the pear tree   &, if it is a walnut tree  , make sure the grain of the wood  runs lengthwise.
L   One always needs to prime d   on wood  to paint there in oil  in order to fill the holes & unevenness, and prime with some stil de grain yellow  & ceruse  mixed in oil , then soften with a feather , which flattens better than a pinceau  . Or when the primer is dry, scrape strongly with a knife .
To use azur d’esmail   in oil , one needs to choose the most delicate. And to make it subtle, one ought not grind it, for this makes it whiten. But one needs to wash it, & the roughest going to the bottom, choose the one that is at the top of the water  or, by inclination, pour out the cloudy water , then gather the azur .

@The one who makes his profession  working in oil   will hardly work well in distemper  if he has not been trained well from adolescence. For the way of working is different, because when washing the pinceau   for distemper , one always leaves it moist. And on the contrary, when one cleans the pinceau   in oil  to soften, one wipes the pinceau   well. Otherwise, the work would run & would soon be disfigured.

The Italians  soften by hatching with a large flat pinceau   which makes serrations.

And they do not lay their shadow all at once like the Flemish , but make them hatching lightest toward the light then a little darker next & and finally a little blacker to better make recede & come up.

In distemper  do not mix your different colors together But  for this makes them die, but use each separately. And in order that they do not dry & that you have time to soften, moisten the back of the canvas .

 Lake  takes long to dry in oil  and for that reason one must grind glass  in it. But one needs to choose crystallin  because it is neater. And because it would be too difficult to grind by itself, one must redden it on the fire, then when entirely red throw it into cold water , & it will be crumbled & pulverized easily for grinding after. Being well ground it  with a lot of water , it resembles ground lead white , but for this it has no body. I think it would be good for casting.
Lead white  is made with sheet lead  beaten subtle & put under the dung .
White varnish of turpentine  or of spike lavender  oil  and turpentine   is colored with pulverized terra emerita  , making it boil together. It gives agold color on silver  and more beautiful if it is burnished. It is dry in a quarter of an hour . Aloe  would make brighter color, but it takes long to dry & the other is dry in a quarter of an hour , in winter  as well as summer .

Vermillion  ground by itself is wan and pale, but ground after lake , it is more beautiful.
For taking the fattiness from marbles  , one grinds ordinary ashes  on it, which is good afterward to make the first primer coat of a panel that is prepared in oil  in order to seal the cracks & chinks of the wood . It has more body than chalk  & it has chalk   a certain fattiness. One mixes it with the aforesaid chalk  or ra   with the colors collected from the vessel  where one cleans the pinceaulx  . It is desiccative and spares colors. On  Once this primer coat is made on the wood , one scrapes with a knife  to even it. Next one makes a second coat of ceruse  or of the poorest  colors mixed together. In a painting in oil on canvas  , one applies only one coat, and the same ashes  can be used there. Also, after one has ground a color, one grinds the inside of a large loaf of bread  on it to remove the fattiness from the marble  .

Tanner 
Tanners use small skins  of lambs  and young goats 
nearly as delicate as parchments  and they keep them in some humid places and keep wetting them. When they want to print some stories on it they lay them in their molding hollows of their figure and then on top they spread some greasy fine earth  used for trimming wool  fabrics, well pressed and beaten and slightly humid and soft and then put on the earth  a small  one-piece board and put the whole under a press and leave that dry there. After the earth  the leather  only remains very neatly printed missing word  of the size of a pea. And then apply on the leather  two or three black copperas  and iron scale  layers one after the other like the tanners  do. And since this tincture is astringent and shrinks the leather will be stronger more more easily printable. Once dried stick on the reverse some fabric  with strong glue , and by doing so one can quickly imitate big statues and very fine medals and paint them and   and are light and can be carried and last for a long time. What can be printed on a relief can be made differently and can be reheated with a hot iron  tool.

The Flemish  do not use any whites for flesh colors in oil   other than lead white  because the ceruse  turns yellow.
4 or 5 year -old walnut  oil  which is clear is the best color, it keeps off dust. The kind which has recently been drawn with the press in the manner of almond  oil  is white, especially if the walnuts ' skin  is removed.

 One needs to make at least three layers of flesh color to accomplish faces in oil . And at the beginning, one puts the black and umber where it is appropriate. Next, the heightening  with lead white  must not be put on the black. Flesh colors and   with ceruse  going in will yellow in five or six months , but lead white  does not change.
Florence  lake  is better than the kind from Flanders  for in Florence  the best dyes are made. To make a beautiful flesh color, the reddest & liveliest lake  is the best, for the kind that contains purpurine   & violet, by admixture of too much alum , makes flesh color like that of one who is very cold. That is why ladies, wanting to color their cheeks , ground Florence  lake  very finely, then fill a little cotton    with it, which they next wrap in a little fabric of Cambray    which is clear. And thus they pounce the lake  on their cheeks  & then, with another clean cotton   , they soften it.
Cristallin   having been ground with water  appears to be  have body, but with oil  it does not have any. It is ground with lake  & with asphaltum , which would not dry for a very long time  without this.
Spike lavender  oil  is commonly put with lead white , d   not entirely pure but mixed with a little walnut  oil . The said spike lavender  oil  would not be good for lake  & colors that do not have body for it would make them crack , but with those that have body & are somewhat greasy, it is quite appropriate.
Verdigris  and orpiment  must first be ground with urine  rather than thinning them with oil . Thus they are beautiful & do not die.

Shadows
When you are making a painting with several persons, just as the flesh colors have to be different, so do the shadows.

In fresco
Azure  is not good here, but bleak, & one needs to work with long  longs pinceaux  . Fresco is not used cont   on wood 

Azure 
Turpentine oil  renders it very beautiful. Assay palma christi  seed oil . Walnut  oil  in Flanders  costs at least a hundred sols  a pint . The azure  requires a little fatty oil  because it has no body.
Azur d’esmail   hates more than any other to be ground, especially with water , for it dies & loses all its color. However, because it cannot be worked if it is coarse, grind not with water  but with oil  & grind it coarsely, and in this way it will not die as much.

Always choose the most delicate one

Pinceaulx  
When the color has dried inside, & you want to clean them, soak them in spike lavender  oil  and they immediately will turn soft again as before, then you will finish to clean them in some walnut  oil . Walnut  oil is not as not  as appropriate to soften them as the spike lavender   kind which is clear like water  & penetrates & does not have body like walnut  oil . The handle of pinceaulx   is made by those who work with care from porcupine  quills , by others from wood  of arrows fromTurkey  with whom  with which they also make small rods to rest their hand  when they are painting .

To work well on a small scale very thin pinceaulx  which have a firm point are  needed. And because the hair taken from the tail of asquirrel 's fur  is mollesin , the most careful take the bristles of the oldest rats  , especially of dormice   if they can find them & put two or three of them in the middle of the pinceau  . These make a straight line like a quill   & all the other hairs  of the pinceau   stick to them as to the point. The bristles of stone martens  & weasels  & small animals which make musk   are even better, for a singlehair  in a pinceau   suffices.
 
 059r
 Lake  & lead white  & ceruse  are easy to work in oil , but every kind of azure  is difficult. And to make beautiful azure , one needs to layer it not with large strokes of the pinceau   but with small strokes of the point. Not only ash from Acre    & azure d’Acre   but mainly azur d’esmail   which one needs to choose to be very delicate, for it  otherwise you will not v   be able to work with it except with great work, and even then you need to thin it with turpentine  to give it body, and mix it with a little  lead white . Any azure  does not want to be ground or washed for it loses color & becomes wan. But putting it powdered on your palette , you will thin it little by little either with walnut  oil  or turpentine oil , dipping  a knife point  in oil , then tempering  it little by little on the said palette .

Shadows
The first shadows which are closer to light need to be clear & thoroughly softened & then the last ones very dark to accentuate well. The Italians  usually make three shadows, the first one, of light, very clear, the second one darker & the third ones quite strong, then blend these three shadows together by hatching them from the darkest to the clearest.

The varnish  is more beautiful on the panel when the color has imbibed well.
 
Azure 
Azure  is more beautiful when imbibed on the panel without  with walnut  oil  with which it has been first thinned, without putting in spike lavender  oil . And if you want to know if it is dry, breathe on it and it will not shine, thus appearing to be well-imbibed. If not it will shine
Azur d'esmail  imbibed in oil   distempered in oil , leaves it & returns to its first nature if you dip it in water .
Colors for working in miniature want to be thoroughly ground, & work them with a point of a pinceau   if you want your work to be well-softened.

Black Painting of armory
Charcoal black  mixed with a little lead white  is very appropriate to make armory, mixing in a little of   azure  if you wish. Charcoal black   by itself is as if bluish.

Painting of crêpe 
First one needs to make the background greyish with charcoal black  mixed with lead white  & a little azure . Then, resu   after it is dry, highlight with strokes & lines in lead white .

Folds in clothing
One needs to take care that none are made which are false, but that only that which happens naturally is imitated. A thick cloth  hardly makes any folds, taffetas  & silk cloth   make more, & crêpe  more still. Make  Observe which ones should go lengthwise & others across.

Desiccative
Lead white  & massicot  are the most desiccative, nevertheless they need a good two days  . If you want to prove whether an oil  is desiccative, temper lead white  with it, & if it produces a crust in a day    soon it means that it will dessicate.

Double layers
Azures , flesh tones and reds are layered twice. The others not.

Mending cracks in a panel
If a painted panel breaks you can glue  it well on the reverse, but to fill in the cracks well in order to paint on it & repair it, it ought not to be with glue  , which rots in damp weather  & would swell when touched with the oil  of the painting. But take white wax , which is harder than the other kind. The oil  mixed in among the wax  prevents it from melting in the sun . The wax  ought not to be hard, but soft as if recently cooled. Apply it on cracks & crevices with the tip of a knife , then scrape.
 
 060r
 and to prevent it from breaking, mix in a little oil  & melt them together & fill the cracks & make them even and paint on them. And the  oil  mixed with wax  will q   help colors to hold since they are also distempered with oil .

First whitening of a panel
One layers two or three times with chalk  tempered with colle de destrempe    on the panel, not with a pinceau   but with a broisse   in such a way as if you wanted to pounce, & leave to dry. And reiterate up to two or three times, then even the last ground layer out well with a knife , then give coat of glue on top , upon which you will next be able to make your impression and then paint. But make sure that your first white is not too thick for it would break easily. Flemish painters  have such panels made by the dozen.

Neat work
When you are working, make sure not to stir up dust, & when you leave your work, cover it so that the said dust will not fall upon it. Also layer your colors as thinly as you can, for if they are thick you will be not be able to soften them thoroughly.

Also do not layer color on color if they are not similar, such as white on black, but rather flesh color on flesh color, & thus with the others. And leave blank the space for shadow or a different color. Ains   in this way, layering each kind of color only on the impression, they will not die & you will work neatly.

Oil 
Walnut  oil  extracted likepeeled almonds   is very white. This one of Palma christi  . And when the oil  has had a little body, the colors soften. For if the oil  is too clear, the colors run & do not  bind, even those that do not have body. Fatty oil  that is not easily imbibed is appropriate for varnish . The oil  is desiccative enough when it dries out as quickly as common varnish . Oils  do not dry as quickly in cold countries as in hot countries. Oil exposed to the sun  is clarified well. But it fattens. If you put in ceruse  or lead filings  or lead white  or calcined pulverized p  glass . To avoid this, put the vial  in clear water .
Colors in  oil , once dry, sometimes do not easily receive the second colors, to prevent this, breathe on them & the color will take.

Varnish  dry in an hour  
Take white turpentine  oil & turpentine  & mastic, pulverized & passed subtly through a sieve  , & boil them together, stirring continuously with a stick  just until it is dry. And put in two liards   of good eau de vie . And if you extract the tear of mastic , it will be whiter & clearer. There is no need to put in turpentine , but only its white turpentine oil  & mastic pulverized  at your discretion, until it has enough body. +

which you will know when it is placed on a knife in the wind  and does not flow. This one is excellent for panels and is dry within an hour   and does not stick like turpentine .

Cleaning panels
Some clean them with soapy water , others with urine , others with white wine , for dust spoils the colors.

Spike lavender  oil 
One ought not to not put any into colors for it is so brisk and penetrating that it makes the colors flake, which next come off. And for this reason, painters  use it to clean their oil pinceaulx   when they have become hard, for it renders them soft & clean immediately, penetrating the dry color which encrusts them. Also, painters , sometimes envious of the work undertaken by another, in the evening  secretly pour a few drops of spike lavender on the  oil  on the top edge of the panel such that, running down, it makes a stain that penetrates as far as the wood  & destroys the colors such that, to make the work even & of an equal composition, they are forced to do everything again and thus lose their work.

Wood  color

One gives a layer of bistre , then a coat of varnish .

Work of the Flemish 
They do all their works in oil  with the tip of the pinceau  , in f   the manner of good illuminators , and grind their colors very finely, protect against dust, and often clean from their pinceau   the bits of hair  which they sometimes leave there, for if these should remain on the work it this , it would prevent neat working, which they are very careful about. In this way their work appears very soft, especially in small work, in which one needs to apply more diligence because one looks at them more closely. They usually  finish the forehead, then the eyes, next the nose, finally the mouth and the rest. But they do not proceed like some others who fo   layer two or three different flesh tones, one yellowish &  the other darker, because the colors always mix & finally die. They simply    make their underlayer properly .
 
 061r
 and even it well then  and once quite dry, they draw their picture & layer their natural flesh color, leaving the space for shadow, like the side of the forehead, & the cheek, & the area around the eyes blank & dry until they have filled in the rest. Next they put their shadows separately, which they do not make as dark as they could not naturally be. In sum, they do not put shadow on flesh color nor flesh color on shadow, but white on white & black on black Thus  & each on their own. In this way their work is neat & the colors do not die.

Flesh colors
You need to make two kinds of it, one more red to make the main layer, the other more pale for the highlights, as around the eyes. And then on this last flesh color, you will lightly touch the main daylight with a little lead white . But avoid putting too much of it for this will look like the face of a dead person. The beautiful Florence  lake  makes a beautiful vivid flesh color that approaches    the complexion  of rose alexandrine   & incarnadine  .

Certain colors do not want to be ground like minium  and massicot . The ashes  do not want to be ground at all.

Rounding off
If you want to highlight well, arr   soften round things by rounding them off with the point of the pinceau  & the rest with the flat part  if it is flat, & thus for the others according to their nature, & lightly with the point of the dry & flattened pinceau  &  with patience.

Lead white 
Without this, you cannot work on a small scale for which one needs to soften with great care. But you cannot do it with ceruse  because it does not have enough body.

Lights
Your pinceau   shows it to you by casting a shadow which must always follow the back of your hand , not in a straight line like this,   for the light would be too crude & too harsh, but obliquely & as if at an incline, thus:   The panel needs to not be facing the light  head-on, but half turned against it. And above all look for a soft light, for it makes soft both the shadow & the work, like a harsh light makes  a harsh work.

 061v
Water  to give light for the painter 
Distill some vine water  & put it into a big bottle . And behind this, put your candle , & it will not hinder your vision.

German chassis 
Germans  who work in miniature make chassis  not of glass , but of canvas  smeared with clear turpentine varnish , namely half turpentine oil  & almost half turpentine , because this light, which is not as bright as glass , makes them see larger features. And when they want to make something subtle like veins de   & similar things, they use pinceaulx  composed of two or three rat whiskers  .

Azur d’esmail   in oil 
One needs too choose the most beautiful  delicate that will be possible, for if it is coarse one cannot work with it in oil . And if you do not find any that is subtle enough, you can grind it well, not with water  but with oil , & grind it thickly. Next lay it on your palette  & mix in a little turpentine , but not much, to give it a bond, and make it to be as thick as butter  or mortar , & then, with a fairly large pinceau  , work it by always moving the pinceau   back and forth. Then, to soften it, hatch across it in a jagged manner with the  the tip of the pinceau  . The highlights will be made with d   the same thinned with ceruse , which, giving it a bond, makes it easier to work. I have seen it used thus. It must be very thick, & such that you all but struggle to spread it with your pinceau  . And it is all the better if you lay down your panel. All these difficulties do not arise when it is very subtle & thin without being ground, and does not run.
Azure  wants to be layered neatly, which is why quan   it always dies somewhat when layers it over old, already tarnished, azure  to mend an old panel. In such matters, it is better to scrape off the old layer & prime again, then put down the azure . It is thus for almost all other colors. Also, azure  ground with oil  always remains shiny, which is not a good sign for azure  for this causes it to die.

Grinding colors
A slab of marble & p  glass a glass  thumb  thick  is more appropriate than anything else for grinding colours neatly, especially for lake  & for whites.

Perspectives
Perspectives in oil take a long time  because of several lines that need to be done with a ruler , and for this reason one usually does them in distemper . One takes the points at  one’s discretion. The main thing in having the knowledge of the point. One usually makes two or three of them, sometimes five.

Ochre 
It is put for faces, hair, skulls and rocks.

Distant people and animals
One first does them roughly in gray or in purple, which is made of cendre d’azur   & lake . Once dry, one highlights & finishes with flesh tones & other colors & white. And it looks better & is sooner done than in white & black. Armies  are painted thus.

Drawing
After you have primed your panel & scraped with a knife  to render it quite even, you will start drawing with the longest piece of charcoal   you can find, for with a short one you would not see your line so well & would do it more roughly. Let the tip of the charcoal   be thin, & in order not to render it dull & blunt soon, drag the tip flat, thus you will constantly sharpen it. Also, hold your charcoal   as far at the end as you can, & do it  & accustom yourself af   make a light line. For if you accustom yourself to drawing delicately with charcoal  , you will do likewise with colors. And he who is rough with charcoal   is never excellent with colors. And by a line of charcoal , masters  pass judgement on their apprentices . First make the outline of your drawing, that is the contour, lightly & without any too scrupulous work, but boldly. In so doing, you will teach yourself to be an artist , and if you need to to undo anything, you will not waste as much time as if you had elaborated it. Next re-work all the distinctive lines, &  do not keep too close to your panel, but occasionally step away from it to better judge the proportions. Once the first drawing seems good to you, retrace all the lines with the pinceau   in rose color or another color in gum  or distemper . Thus you will work more confidently with colors, and with less effort .

 062v
Drawing
To become an artist , one needs to draw by eye  , without compass  or ruler . Masters  do not allow apprentices  to do this.
When the priming has been long  done, it becomes greasy. One needs to rub it with ash  & water .

Perspective
To know the point, one needs to lay down a ruler  over the lines, & at the intersection of these the point will be. Some make a hole at the end of their rulers  to fix the point by that hole & move the ruler  about. Others lay down a ruler  across the panel, then on this laid-down ruler  they set the tip of another ruler , which, attached to the former by way of a screw , moves about & reaches as far as necessary without losing the point. The ruler  and compass  without the judgement of the eye   cause errors. Perspective is very difficult.


 

To paint perspective in oil , you ought not to use a ruler , for you would smudge everything. But when layering your colors you need to keep to the  & follow the lines of your first drawing.
Also, to make plumb  lines , which go from the top to make vif   to the bottom of the panel, you need to have a thread   with some piece of lead  attached to one end & a little hook  to the other for hanging the said thread   from the top of the panel.


 

Panel
To draw & layer the colors, especially in oil , you need to hold your panel as upright as you can on the easel , for if it is slanted there is a danger that some dust & dirt might stick on it. Keep clean & without dust the place where you paint.

Amaranth  color
Although it is said to be immortal, it is nonetheless the case that white wine  removes its tint & turns claret-colored, & next the dried flower  ends up white. Note that thus wine , & I have tried it. Eau de vie  does as much.

Drying of oil 
If the oil  does not dry out, put in massicot  & minium . There is no better oil than walnut  , for it does not dry out too soon nor too late.

Casting
The Germans  use lead from Flanders   because it is very soft.  And to cast better they take lead ore  & melt it, & separate what is melted from the from the filth  & ore , & pour it into a separate vessel , then the bottom  they cast with it. For the lead  must not have been used in works before, but rather completely new. Some cast into molds of iron  & copper  .

or new lead  coming from the mine . They melt it twice in a crucible . In the first one, they cleanse it of filth . In the second, they en  cast.

Shadows
German painters  make their shadows on flesh colour of people with ground jet , stil de grain yellow  & ochre .

Bistre 
It is only used in distemper , & with this wood color is made.

Verdigris  and another very beautiful bright green
One ought not to grind it with water  alone, for that makes it die. To render it beautiful in distemper , some grind it with vinegar , but that makes it turn pale & become whitish. To render it beautiful, grind it with urine  & leave to dry. Then, whenever you like, grind it with oil . And after you have collected it with the spatula , before finishing to clean the marble  , grind stil de grain yellow  on it. And you will have a very beautiful green.

 063v
Velvets  and blacks
One needs to make  the middle  main layer very d   dark, & the folds & highlights of the same very bright with white, & on the edge of its light, you make a white line. For blue & green velvets , you highlight  touch with shading of peach  pit  black which is very black. For lake , black of charbon de pierre   which makes a reddish black on lake  for velvets  . The common charcoal  makes a whitish black.

Snow-covered landscapes
Only three colors are used for it: white, black & bistre .

Softening
If you have worked & made your ground layer with some desiccative color, such as minium  & similar, finish softening while the work is fresh, for if you were to wait until the next day , it would be dry & you would not be able to finish it neatly.

 064r
Working neatly
Never put down, if you can, two colors one on top of the other. But after you have made your design carefully, keep the space for shadows alone by themselves & for the lights & highlights individually as well, without layering a color all across & then highlighting or shading on it. And in this way, you further your work, economise your colours & work neatly, which is the reason that, the colors not being muddled nor mixed together, they do not die & you soften the colors better, since they are not so thick.

Fatty oil 
It is not good for working with colors because it makes them thick, & as difficult to work as azur d’esmail . Use, then, the clearest walnut  oil  that you can, & the freshest.

Vermilion 
One ought not to keep it in water  when soaked ground  with oil  for it loses its color. It is better to choose whitish vermilion  than dark & blackish. For vermilion  is usually mixed with a little lake , without which it would hardly be different from minium . But the pale kind one casts more vivacity than the dark one. It is not desiccative, & for this reason one mixes in calcined cristallin  .

Oil  colors in water 
Usually, after grinding them one puts a fo   piece of tin leaf  on top, & one puts them in water  to prevent them from drying out. But this is more appropriate for ceruse , lead white , minium  & massicot  than for the others, for lake  dies there & loses its color, as does azure vermilion .

Double layer
Verdigris   does not die, & thus does not need to be layered twice. But lake  & others, & especially flesh color, the  require two layers. Colors hardly change when they are dry.

Yellow ochre 

One needs a little of it in every flesh color.

Softening

One softens in the same way on oiled paper  as on wood . But it is easier to soften on canvas , because the softening must be rougher on it.

Eye
 
Every eye must follow the circle of the compass  & not be flat & square.

Apprenticeship of the painter 
First, one gives him an egg  to do in which one has him make half a face, then a whole one with the ears, next the neck, then the parts of the body separately, next joined, then one figure, then two & three, finally a history, teaching him how to hold the charcoal  by the end, & also the pinceau  . Once he knows how to draw, one teaches him how to layer colors.

One also presents him with these strokes & lines
C  T he figure of the egg  is the main pattern for faces and for bent bodies , as the cross is the model for a straight & whole figure. Without these strokes you will never do well.
 
Softening
To soften well, one ought not to layer the colors thickly, but rather layer them twice, except for azur d’esmail  .

All colors that have no body in oil  have none in distemper , and  but in distemper  they sink to the bottom. Distemper  colors want to be greasy, which is recognised when they gel on the palette  once distempered in oil .

Straight lines
You can use the ruler , but do not lay it flat on the panel, but as if lifted off, & resting on the edges of the panel. Otherwise you would smudge everything, & also you would not see the stroke well.

Distemper 
Distemper  colors need to be kept  darker pr   while you temper them, because they whiten while drying . But oil  colors remain the same in color.

 065r
Shadows
 Because blacks make in different colors, some a reddish black, others tend towards blue, and others towards green, choose those which tend towards yellow to make beautiful shadows in oil , for shadow, especially that of men, is yellowish. And for this effect use very strongly ground jet , which you will mix with a little yellow  ochre  & lead white . Or else, after you have ground your lead white bro   and clean p   gathered it with the  , grind the jet  into it. Thus it will be more desiccative, & making on its own a yellowish black. A little white mixed in renders it perfect for men's shadows. Blacks which make a greenish black are appropriate for women's shadows. Take, then, some black of  , a little sap-green  & bistre , & you will have a perfect shadow for women in distemper .

The powder of orberé grain   is darker than umber  & when you lack umber , the said powder will do, but it does not have body.

Flesh color
You must know well the mixing of colors & the appropriate shadows, but above all make sure to soften them well. And note & observe that a thing which appears flat needs to be softened lengthwise, as if going from lett re a ga   right to left like 
 
, and whatever ought to appear round must be softened in circles.

Mirror 
When you make flesh colors, it is good to have a cristallin  mirror  , which represents well after nature, and in which it  you will see if your shadows are soft enough or too crude. But do not look at it with a candle , for firelight  will make the shadows reddish. The painter  also teacher himself with the mirror , for he sees in it what the natural can do.

Greasy colors
If some part remains shiny and does not seem dry after the layered colors have penetrated, it means that this part is greasy, & that the second colors one layers on would not take on the dry layer , unless you rub this part with soap  or breathe on it, because the humidity will make the colors take.

One cannot layer oil  on cut paper  & model as in distemper  because the colour would run. Thus,  to gild  with or mat  , one needs to pounce & then layer the gold color  with the pinceau  .

All greasy colors, such as ceruse  and minium , massicot , ochre , lead white  are good for making gold color.

Any color or thing that thickens when water  is put with it when it is being ground has body. But those that lack it, such as cristallin  , lake  & become clear.

 065v
Semi-lively colors
When colors a  absorb into the canvas , it means that it has been primed only once, & for this reason they become matte without being  shiny. But this is the best way, as long as you re-coat it twice, for in this manner, the colors, having more body, do not die & are all the more beautiful for it, especially azure  ,lake  & those do not have body. But those who want to rush their painting prime twice on the first go, to be done with it. Thus the colors do not absorb, also they will not last as long. The second layer of these does not absorb & remains shiny.

Painting large figures
You need to put your charcoal  at the tip of a stick  such that you make your first drawing from a distance because up close, you would not be able to judge proportions as well as from a certain & sufficient distance. Also, when you paint up close, hold your charcoal  at the farthest end, & practically with your fingertips . For in this way you will acquire an artist 's l  touch & give your hand  effortless facility.

Glazing
One usually glazes with colors which do not have body, such as lake  & verdigris . However, to use other kinds, one mixes in plenty of calcined & crushed cristallin , which also has no body & makes  lightens their thickness.

White and black
It is good that an apprentice  should work with white & black for two or three years  to become an artist .

Lead white 
It does not die & has a lot of body.

After nature
There are some who paint after nature on oiled paper , & if they do not finish in one go, they put their paper  & unfinished picture in water  so that it shall not dry.
Illuminators  painting on paper  temper their colors with gum  & mix in a little soap  to make them run better.
Painters  must all learn how to draw after nature, for to them it is travel provisions & revenue & sure means of earning their passage when travelling across the lands with only their cocon  .

Priming layer
One needs to be quite careful about this, & not do it, as some will, with gold color which is made with the washing water of oil pinceaulx  , because verdigris  & other corrosive colors which are in it will in the end cause the death of the colors that are meu   layered on next. It is good to do it.

with ceruse , & a bit of yellow ocher , & a little massicot , & make it not too thick so that it does not crack.

 066r
Double layers
The Flemish  & those who paint panels by the dozen only make one layer & finish at the first go. But the colors soon die. And when they are layered twice, they do not die. One needs to layer them lightly & not very thick, to soften them well.

Shadows
For women, asphaltum , umber  & a little lake .

Painting in distemper  on wood 
Because it is very tedious to paint in distemper  on wood , and because one is at great pains to make a good a  face on it, some thin their colors with egg glair  passed through a sponge , or mixed with the yolk , water , & thoroughly beaten with the skin of the fig tree  . With this | they paint & soften on the wood , as with oil , and this supports the varnish , but this does not last.

Colors in oil  that are imbibed
It is best that colors in oil  are imbibed, that is to say they do not remain shiny after they are dry, for they do not die. But if in some places they are shiny, it is that the fattiness of the oil  has remained in that part which would make the colors die. The varnish  mends all this & unites & renders it similar in one place as in another.
One needs gold color to be laid down thick, for if it is clear, it would be imbibed & would run.

On canvas  & in distemper , one gilds with bole  & honey  & a little garlic juice .

Gilding molding for panels with or mat  
see the other side of this folio this mark: * 
The Flemish  give one layer of colle à destrempe   on the moulding, then mix lamp black  or soot black  with the same colle   & let dry. Next they pounce some moresque  in the corners & paint it with minium , massicot , & ochre de ru  , and a little yellow ocher  , mixed with fatty oil  in which they clean their pinceaulx  for oil  , because the three aforesaid colors are gripping & dry immediately. Next they lay down the gold , then varnish on top of all. And it seems to some by this means that all this black is painted in oil , but it would not be good because the gold  would attach itself everywhere & not only to the moresque . Go back to the top to * 
* Or mat   

It is made with massicot , minium , ochre de ru  , & yellow ocher , so that the composition resembles gold . Gild the day after un jo   it is laid down if you in the  made the groundlayer the evening  of the color. After having gilded, let it dry & rest one day  , next rub the gilding with a feather  & cotton    in order that no burrs remain, then varnish with Flanders  varnish , which you make mixed with a little eau de vye  , to render it desiccative.
The varnish  will be dry in an hour  . It will increase the color of gold. And this or mat   holds in the rain , even if one rubs it. But it must be well dried for eight or ten days  .
Gold color that is made of different colors cleaned from pinceaulx  for oil   is not so good, & with time , tarnishes the gold because of the verdigris . One must not touch with a finger  the layer made for  the gold because that will keep it from attaching itself. The or moulu   is spoiled if water  touches it, but the or mat   holds well in the rain  & in water . One must not burnish it, because the tooth  would remove it. Gather the burrs & small flakes that the cotton    makes lift off when the gold  is dry & you clean it, for an ounce  is still gold . In Flanders , women make gild . It is more beautiful when it is a little thick, but in France  they beat it too delicately.
Breathe on the gold color, and if it tarnishes, it is dry enough, but if it does not receive the vapor of the breath, it is not enough.
One must not gild or mat   after with  having gilded . But wait one day or one night , But take heed to not  and when it appears as dry, it grips the gold , next one varnishes.

When gold color starts to grip, it is a sign that in ten or twelve hours   it will be dry & appropriate for gilding .
* 
To make or mat   beautiful, put in a little varnish  or fatty oil , not from that which is made from the cleaning of pinceaulx  , but the pure, which is made fatty in the sun  or mixed with ceruse .
Or mat   of this sort is scarcely less beautiful than es  burnished gold  , and lasts longer in the rain , & besides, & is made sooner. Burnished gold  is cracked with time  & comes apart in the rain .

Pinceaulx  
To make them well, cut the hair from the tail of a squirrel ’s fur , as much in one go as one can hold in a card  folded up into a small tube . And putting it thus into the aforesaid folded card , tap it  & shake it  such that the hair  gathers together & becomes of the same length. Put one or two bristles of a rat ’s whiskers  in the middle, then, grabbing it with the fist & pinching it well with the thumb  & index finger , thoroughly dip the tip of all this hair  in water , then, moving close to

light, pull out the hairs  which make the tip too long with the ends of your fingernails , and this until the tip seems good to you, & and until you notice in it the rat  hairs  which are entirely black & the hair of the petit-gris   is at the  whitish from the root to the middle. When it pleases you, bind b   and tighten it very well with a thread  in two places, then cut the excess &  fit it in a quill  of a convenient size for it, of a duck  or a crow  for the small ones. Good pinceaulx   are those that, once soaked in water , do not bulge when you trace on your hand .

Oil 
All oil  which is imbibed by paper  & once heated by fire evaporates  & leaves the paper  clean, like turpentine  & spike lavender  oil , is good for making varnish .

Sand
Everything ground & tempered becomes porous, according to some.

Bellows furnace 
Before you put in the metal ,  it is necessary that it be red at the bottom, like like a charcoal  & well inflamed. Next, you    fill it & cover the charcoal  & adjust the bellows , otherwise the metal  on top would melt as a result of the bellows  & its bottom would be curdled & cooled & would not run. But if you proceed in this manner you will melt everything you like.

Varnish  on paper 
The Germans  make boxes p  covered with painted paper  & varnish it with glair of the egg  mixed with gum  & a little oil , not of spike lavender  , but another odorant  that resembles olive  oil  . Every work done with glair  supports oil . It is with this that painters  trick the poor peasants , painting their bands of taffeta  with this glair , to be done sooner. But the first rain  carries away everything.

Files 
If they are not trempées à pacquet , that is, in the manner described, with soot , salt , & vinegar , they will not be good. The large square files  used by locksmiths  to draft their work are only made of fer doulx  , But the soft files  should be made of steel . Founders  whose work is to repair latten  & copper  should have their files coarse otherwise they fill up with copper  which makes them smooth & soon renders them useless. Latten , which is more brittle, welcomes softer files than copper  does.

Oxen  foot bones for sand 
Once having been burned well twice & pulverized, they mold very neatly in sand & need not be reheated, but simply heated with the flame of straw . But if you mold them in a noyau , give it its first layer, simple  & very thin, with a pinceau  , & leave to dry at ease. Next fortify the following layers with wadding  mixed with the said tempered bone sand .

It is the neatest sand that can be found for copper .

Huiles d'essence  
Walnut   oil  mixed with as much of turpentine  & distilled by an alembic  renders an essence whiter than common water . But this has no body & does not give a bond for colors that are immediately imbibed, and then leaves the color without stickiness and faded. These, imbibed in this way, would not let you work or soften, no more than in distemper . But you rectify this fault, by giving it a little body with turpentine , not at all so thick as for varnish. And thus you can work with azur d’esmail   & will make a perfect lead white . Turpentine varnish  made with this oil  is dry in one hour  .

Fanciful tables
You can make various grooved compartments & on these, paint fishes  naturally & with color on simple carton    & if you wish, on silvered  and burnished paper  to represent the scales. And next, cover them with very clear lantern horn . You can apply the very same to other works.

Planting trees 
Trees  need to be planted in dry weather, &  a lot of earth gathered all around their feet, like a mound, so that the rain won't fill the holes & drown the trees .

Casting
I have tried four kinds of sand for lead  & tin : chalk , crushed glass , tripoli  & burnt linen , all four excellent. But as for the chalk , it needs to be of the softest kind you can find, like the Champagne  one that painters  use . It releases very neatly, does not need to be moistened with magistra  or anything else, but needs to be completely dry, in its natural state, finely pulverized. The first cast is always the neatest, however it will well withstand two or three. But there is only the first one that you need to take heed of, when you want to remake your box mold  to take new powdered chalk  that has not yet been used for works, for the one previously used in the box mold has dried out & has no stickiness & bond like the fresh one. Crushed glass  can be made from common glass sand, however cristallin  is more excellent, for common glass  contains glass  salt of saltwort  only, but cristallin  contains both salt of tartar  & saltwort  all together, which both help fusion, the glass  once calcined & reduced to as if to its prime substance. In order to calcine it perfectly, throw your glass , lumps of whichever sort, among the largest possible lit charcoals  that you can, if you are lacking  some other t d e foeut  violent heat source. And when it will be well red, throw it into water .
Putty  is considered excellent for these two metals .

 and immediately you will be able to crumble it between your fingers   and to easily grind it in a metal  mortar , or better yet, in an iron  one . Next, it will be easy to grind it, not only  on common marble  that would corrode , but on porphyry  , and it is necessary that it be finely ground with water   so that when putting it on your fingernail  , you find it soft without any asperity like the colors that the painters  grind for oil . You can use au lii   this one, once dry, in a box mold instead of sand, without moistening it with anything nor reheating it. If you do not like it, fumigate the cavity with sulfur  smoke or de p    with the tip of the flame of a wax candle   that barely makes smoke, and it will make a very neat & shiny & polished work, in pure  lead  & tin . I would say the same for finely pulverized tripoly  that does not want to be not  reheated or moistened. Burnt linen  gives less trouble than others, because it does not need to be reheated, nor moistened, & molds and releases  very neatly & very , subtlety & releases well  neat, like the previous ones & withstands several castings. First you ought to burn it with a flame, then leave it to rest & to be consumed with its fire until it is completely dead, then finely grind it on marble   or on a paper  . But because a lot  And if you reheat it in a crucible , red hot due to the fire, to render all of it fine & impalpable, I believe it will be even better. But because a lot of linen  is reduced to very little when burned, if you want to save some, you can sprinkle only the medal that you want to mold & cover it, and fill the box mold  with crushed slate , which molds also very neatly, but note that the first cast is always the most beautiful & the neatest. If you cast at your convenience soft tin  that seems to be burnished in little wheels that pewterers  sell, comes out very neatly & approaching the color of silver , without mixing in anything else, it is true that one ought to cast it rather hot, & so that the molded object should be four fingers   away from the cast. In order to know its heat, first melt it well, so hot with such a degree of heat   that it promptly burns a paper   or straw   placed inside, by simmering. Then remove it from the fire & leave it to rest a little & cast the tin  mixed

 with half lead  comes out almost better than tin pure  or   or pure lead , even though in any case they come out well. Nevertheless take care not to cast lead  not as hot as tin . In big works it is necessary to moisten the sands with magistra  or egg white .

Joiner 
Three things take the longest, leaves, hair & garlands.

Sand
You should not choose for casting the one that is in any way lean & arid, such that it does not bind at all, like the one from the sea   or desei  from sandy paths  dried out by the sun  . But choose  them or in t   preferably from quarreries  ries  or rock caves , because that one is best, as long as it is very fine. You will know the vein if, in the greyish rocks  or quarries qu   that seem to be made of arene  , you see after rainy weather  , certain little amounts like dust attached to the said rocks , or if a little piece flakes off, easily crushed between your hands  , due to humidity. You will also find it in lean soils , which comes off in lop   large lumps like stones of tuf  et ne  , or among terres boulvènes   , which are much better than those from fat & strong earths . And one ought not to take it from the surface, for fear that it be mixed with common earth , but three or 4 feet   below & the closest to the tuf   or stone . Since it comes out in large lumps one would say it starts to form itself in stone. But when it is wet, it comes apart easily. One needs to make sure that when breaking it up it is well granular, & that when crushing it between the fingers  , it renders itself really very fine,  like impalpable , keeping nevertheless its asperity of arene  , without muddying  the fingers   like clay . It dries up slightly on the fire, then it disintegrates & passes finely through a double sieve  or a linen  sleeve , then takes moistures with wine  or magistra  & @ / Verte 

The Toulouse molder  reheats it strongly then grinds it finely on marble   and passes it through a linen   & moistens pass   it with wine .  He makes the cast very broad &  ne   flat & barely deep.  He casts pure latton used for scales  & similar thin things. He casts very hot.

 The sand near my area  is very excellent. But one ought to, in order to make an excellent work, take it fresh, which has been used. For it dries out after having been cast several times & is lean & has no body. If you cast some fine work which has hardly any thickness, it is necessary that your substance of copper  be very hot so that it penetrates & runs.  Some mix in lead  with the fonte , but it is for large works & not for small ones.
Sand from oxen  feet twice-burned & finely ground  melts more neatly with copper , & without a chappe , than sand that I have seen. I have cast a high relief medal with it, and f   with a thickness as delicate as a knife  blade or a card .  And being a hollow on one side, opposite the relief which was on other side.
It is necessary that lean sands  be more moistened than others, namely with magistra  or good pure wine  or boiled wine with elm tree  roots   & similar things. But very fine sands , like burned linen  which is fat & soft on its own, want to be applied dry.
All moistened sand wants to be very beaten & stirred in order to be ground finely \& to flatten out the clods that it makes in itself when it is bathed.
The olive  oil  that some mix in with beaten egg white  makes it become porous.
Sand of calcined glass  withstands several castings, but there are only the first ones.  It also becomes porous.
Latten  comes out on its own, but it runs too quickly.  It is good to mix it with a little copper , like a quarter part , with the substance of skillets .
Founders  cast well box molds up to 30 or 40 lb ,  but not more.

It is good for big work, but for small ones it is troublesome for releasing. Il   because it crumbles.  It is good that it be alloyed with some fat thing which has bond such as molded tripoly  or ab  burned felt  or sal ammoniac  or tripoly  & similar things.

 When you have molded, it is good to reheat your mold on the smoke of the substance you are melting, because the cast absorbs the quality oe  f  the metal , which runs afterwards more easily in something that comes from it.
Human  bones  are the best for casting once calcined.
To cast neatly, it is necessary that your substance be quite hot & to achieve this, when your substance is melted, throw in some iron scales , or in powder or otherwise E  , for it heats copper  a lot & cleanses it of its fat .  At the end, when you want to cast, add some saltpeter , by folding your additions in a paper   so that others not know what you are adding.
Sheep  foot bones  are even better than ox  foot bones .

Cendreée  earth  molds very neatly.
Ashes  do not have enough body to withstand copper .
It is best not to mix the sands, but fill the box mold  with one only.
Latten  is always fat, & does not mold neatly. One finds that it comes out better alloyed with a quarter  of copper , but it needs to be cast very hot.
Copper  comes out well with a bit of metal . If you mix in metal  within latten , it will be more brittle & more troublesome.
A slightly coarser sand has more body.
Sand from  corp   rock  is always better, which seems like tuf   in lumps, which has a beautiful &  very fine grain, & a little fat. One crushes it, then one dries it in a skillet  on the fire, until it is  stops smoking, then one passes it through through a double sieve  &  fine, & one molds with it.
Copper  or latten  cannot come out well if the medal does not sufficient thickness, & if it does not have it, give it some with some wax .

Some cast through a hole made in the middle of the reverse side of the medal.

Some wanting to cast large works in latten y   mix in the sand some crushed glass  to give the earth  some bond. But it makes it porous, and needs to be repaired.

Sugared  and mulled wine 

When the English  have a cold, they mull wine  in this way. They heat wine  in a large tin  pot until it boils, and when it becomes frothy,  they light it with burning paper  to determine if it is hot enough. After, to mull the whole of it, they pour it from one vessel into another, as if they wanted to churn eau panée , and as they do it, someone else lights with a burning paper  what is falling from the one vessel into the other, such that you would think you were pouring fire. When the wine  is mulled enough, heat it again a little while adding a few cloves  & a sufficient quantity of sugar . And they the English    drink it when it is as hot as possible in order to overcome their melancholy.
English  commoners put sugar  in wine  as a substitute for new sweet wine , which they cannot have because, owing to the long sea crossing, the wine  loses its sweetness and clarifies itself before it reaches their country.

And to render it clearer, put into the concoction a little lump of camphor . It is true that with this it is not dry so soon. Heed well that the spike lavender  oil  will be good, clear & not fatty, otherwise your varnish  will be worth nothing. You can test it d   by soaking some paper  in it & heating it. If the oil , which will evaporate, leaves the paper  clean, without being  a yellow mark, it is good, if not, it is fatty.

There are no spiders  in Ireland , & if one touches them with some wood  that they have there, they die. That is why some rich people from England  make their floors with this wood , & in this way, they do not have any spiderwebs.

Sand
The cimolée   is very good for casting in copper , but one ought not take the one from cutlers  , because it is only sludge , but rather the one of those who moulent   mold large shears.
Pierres de filieres , which knife grinders  use for whetting, mold very neatly, once scraped, for lead . It is commonly slate -colored. One frequently brings them to Toulouse  from around Carcassonne  .

Printers ’ letters
Those who make them, mix into the lead  some nails  nailheads   & old horse shoes , & antimony  which makes it all melt. This composition is strong for printing, &holds steadfast. It runs and is good for casting in lead .

Casting in copper 
It is necessary that the box mold  be well smooth & that it fits well also on the board  where it sits, so that it holds firm & does not shift when one moulds. It is necessary that the sand be clean & well chosen and well reheated, & pulverised very finely on the marble  , for the one that you want to put first on the medal, and when molding you press strongly. Guard against oiling  your medal, for this would make it porous. Reheat slowly and reheat well, & let cool. Moisten your sand with wine boiled with elm  root , and cast latten  which comes out well, namely from the substance of the trebuschets   and similar thin things. Make your cast broad & even if it is barely thick, it will not be worse off, but it will enter well in the mold . Cast from the foot of the medal, so that the face, further away from the heat, comes out better & sweetened from the violent heat. And if your box mold  does not have vents, make some qu   in the sand, which come, from the corners of the piece, to render themselves into the cast. Cast very hot, something that you will know, when you cast a little leftover substance in the one which has already been melted, & if it melts quickly, this is a sign it is fo   well hot. At that time, invigorate the heat of your furnace  with bellows  of the right size, keeping the mouth of the furnace  well covered with some big copper  tile   or other similar thing, which should be very red before you cast. When you want to cast, take your well red mollettes   & the crooked iron   as well, to clean the charcoals  which are in your substance. Having cast, rub your work with a latten  wirebrush . The grindings from sharpening large scissors & large knives  is very good for copper .

One believes it to be a great secret to add in it persicaire  , which renders them soft as lead .Try to extract salts  from it.

Casting
Lead , which is mortified & weighty, wants to be cast hot, more so than tin . And when it is not hot enough, it makes lines in the medal. It Straw  burns in it, provided it is hot. One can make a solder  so soft & runny that it can be melted in a tin  dish . It is composed of one part looking glass tin , one part soft tin , & another part lead . It runs very neatly and is cast in leaves, but the work is very brittle   & prone to breaking. The best solder  is the common one for casting well, but  is  leaves certain lumpy points. Alloy lead  with tin  so that the ingot that you will cast comes out even & shiny & polished, & without any eyes or bubbles except for a small point in the middle. And this sign will tell you that there is enough tin , otherwise the lead  dominates too much. Sand is good for lead  & tin . The good one is very thin & fine & lean, which however sticks together between one’s fingers  . The sand wants to be reheated before being put to work. And once  to mold with it , it wants to be very moistened & then reheated, not all at once nor with a burst of fire, for this corrupts & makes it shrink & crumble as well. But if you reheat it gently, it renders itself very stiff, once well moistened. One ought to pass it through a shirt sleeve   for the finest one, in order to first put some on the piece to mold.
One makes a solder  with quicksilver but which is white, but it is brittle. Make your box mold  so that it joins well & that one does not see the daylight between the joints.
The Germans  cast their leads  very thinly, rather than very thickly, because it seems they come out better, but so that are not too pliant, being so thin, they mix a little tin  with the said lead , which otherwise would fold up like wax .
The blackest lead , so say some, is the best & the softest & which runs the best. You will know its goodness by rubbing it with your finger  , which will render it very black quickly . 
The alloy good for running lead  & tin  is per one lb  of lead , one lb  & a half of tin aultr  , so that the tin exceeds more than one part . It is solder  which flows well & that is good for casting, but it is brittle.

To make the lead  flow well, one puts in a little quicksilver .

Rub cuttlefish  bone  on a well smooth table  to flatten it & one against the other & cross the two bones  with pegs  to mark the place.
Cuttlefish  bone   molds lead  better than anything else. But try it to see if it needs reheating. One ought to mold on the back of the bones  & from this side for the marrow  is more delicate there. 

The bone marrow  towards the tail is more delicate & does have not as many stripes & molds more cleanly. The shell  which holds the marrow , once calcined, is good for making sand.

When you cast lead , one ought to cast it cast very neatly rather  hot, & not at once & shake the box mold  a little & cast two or three times. However, if it is cast too hot,  it will rise up & swell. When it is very hot, it becomes blue, let it then pass this color deva   & rest a little before casting.

Some, such as printers , mix iron filings  or pins  in the lead , but  in order to render it hard. But this renders it brittle &not  it breaks under the hammer .

Take a wirebrush  to clean your molds .

 If you wish to raise water  higher than its source, make a pipe descend as in A. to B. to give it push  , then from B. to C. make the pipe ascend, but not quite to the height of the source, here represented by the dotted line, and then make it descend again in a pipe from C. to D., and then let it rise higher than the line demarcating the height of the source, and do this successively until you reach the desired height. Remark nonetheless that the length of the descending pipe is always twice as long as the ascending pipe. This cone also fills itself and demonstrates a perpetual fountain which you can adapt into a rock, attracting the water with which it is filled by the tip here marked, by sucking and breathing in. You can also make a watering can pipe in this way, so long as the bent pipe is just as long as the straight pipe, but does not extend as far down.

Founders of small works @ in tin   
They usually cast with solder , even the things that should not become empty, for the latter require fine & soft tin , which however would not release, & would not become empty if it was mixed or had some looking glass tin mix in  it, just like they put in a little of it in soft tin . They carve their works on stones of which are made the sharpening stones or files of barbers  , which are found in great flakes towards the mountains , & resemble slate . They are three colors of them: reddish, which is not as perfect as the others because it does not last as long in the fire & as ,one dard   of the color of dark slate , the other whitish. When they have some relief, first they imprint it on carton   , as thick as one finger  , to serve as a pattern , then with a little compass  & little matching iron fittings , they carve their figures, having first flattened their stones  & worn down one against the other, they make their p   molds of three or four pieces, to make a circle or a square which joins perfectly, because the stones  render themselves even. Before casting, they rub the mould with tallow , which has quickly absorbed it because it is hot. Then, taking fine powder of quicklime  in a linen  , they rub the mould while beating with the linen   on top, then blow a little on top to prevent it from becoming porous. The main thing is to make vents. If the work is big and they make it in such a way as seen here, they pierce a hole in the part of the medal, that is least visible. And with a gimblet  they pierce the mold on the side of the medal. 
 
And if they want their work to stay pierced in whichever place, they drive in a piece of cork   at this place in the mold . And the lead  or tin  will not attach to it. 

Make sure the pegs  of your box mold  enter easily so that opening  it will easily open without shifting anything; and that your box molds  fit well together; & the table is very flat . 

Try to carve with distilled vinegar .

Try calcined oyster  shells ; one says that they are excellent for molding.

Sand
One can find an excellent one on the little hill  of Puy David  near Thoulouse  for lead , tin  & copper . It does not want to be too reheated much because, drying out all at once, it loses its stickiness & burns at the first arrival of metal , which makes the work lumpy & not neat. It is better to reheat from a distance, rather than with a straw  flame, which generates des   some filth . Before filling in the box mold , you can put in the finest sand you have in a very fine linen  , & pound the medal dry and then the moistened sand that you put on top, which has more body, will grip it.
Tallow  makes it porous.
Fixed mercury  mixed in when one wants to cast, makes metal lead  run. But if it is pure, one ought to cast very hot so that it runs, and vents.

Earth  for molding
Tanner 's earth, or the one with which potters  make a whitening on pots  to make lead  run better on them & to prevent the lead  from being absorbed into them, is very good for molding the cavities of things you want mold in relief. It releases better than plaster  or sulphur  which become hard once they have set.  For the earth  being ready, one ought to be beat hard so that it does not crack. If the piece is very large you can mould it in several parts. If you reheat it, it is necessary that it be over a closed fire. One finds this earth  at Fosseret  & in another place called Ox .

Plaster 
It is necessary that it be well heated, which you will recognize when cooking it in an iron  or metal  skillet , you mix it with an iron  rod , & if it attaches to the iron , it is not heated enough, if not, it is good. The water  with which you moisten should be a little warm & the mold  made with the aforesaid earth  also a little hot. The work of plaster  does not last & the faces & delicate things break if one does not give a coat of glue .

Carton 
One ought to take paper from Florence  , which is the finest, & crush it & soak it several times & change the water every day , so that it does not smell bad, & since you will have moulded it in the cavity, put a linen   over it, & from the back, rub the back of the paper  with a tooth , as if you wanted to burnish it, and it will mould very neatly. Then glue  the cloth  on the back with strong glue . 

 081v
Sand
Only brick  very finely sifted, & worn down one against another, is good for all castings of lead  and copper , mixed with urine . It is necessary this be whitish brick .

Making copper  and latten  run
Put in, at the end, when it is very hot and you want to cast, sal ammoniac  & saltpeter , which removes filth  & heats it. Mix some ardides   with the latten . @ Guard against the metal  touching the iron  or the latten  of the box mold , but cover it with sand  or lute . Make the cast very even.

Sand
Calcined black pebbles from the river   are good for lead , but they are shaken loose for metal .
There is only   clay earth with which one can make tiles  , reheated & reddened & passed through a sleeve  finely moistened with glair .
Willow  charcoal  is excellent for sand for b  lead .
Latten  runs better.

Casting with a box mold 
It is good to make it with boxwood  . Turn it in order to make it even, as this is important for the casting. Lute  also, or cover the mouth of the box mold  with sand so that the melted metal , or lead ,or copper  does not touch the box mold ’s iron  or latten , because it makes it brittle, & makes it porous. Also make sure that the cast is always higher than the mold . Also guard against the cast being too wide or too deep because the narrower, the better. For when it is big, the weight of the substance that runs breaks & shakes loose the mold  & makes it porous. When you have cast, gently hit the box mold  frame, so that the substance spreads better. Black lead of saulmon   from the first melting makes a very neat one.

Watchmakers 
To distribute the teeth proportionately on their wheels, they do not use a compass because there is no compass so fine that it can draw distances as small as those of the small wheels. But they make a platform (as they call it) out of latten that has been  divided into various circles, & each of those  circles  is divided into equal sections marked by a point. And each circle has a certain number of points , as for example  one has  30, another 36, others 40 &. Then, on the pierced center of the platform, they place the little wheel. And on the center of the wheel there is  a flat line or an alidade which points to the number on the circle that you want to mark on your wheel. Then with a point, they draw a line on the wheel. Then they return the alidade to the following point, & they thus go on marking it the dial . And to mark the points on the circles of their platform, they divide the circle in three & then divide this third part into as many sections as is necessary with regard to the total division of the circle. &, in this manner, they make the teeth's division & distribution as fine as they please.

Casting lead  in lead 
There are some who make their cavities with thick lead , then cast lead  in them.
Lead  when not cast hot enough, is white, & blacker when cast well hot.

One can make a lead  mold . & to cast in it, fumigate it with candle soot . But it is never that neat.

Ways of casting in bronze 
Latten of potin  cor  , which is the most brittle, molds more neatly, according to the opinion of many people, than fine latten of skillets , just like all fine latten  molds neater than red copper . If you want to cast something fine & thin, the entire secret is to cast as hot as possible so that the substance boils. You will recognize that it is hot enough when it smokes a lot and while stirring it throws sparks. To heat well, place your crucible  as low as possible & at the very bottom of the forge , so that the bellows fra   beat on the middle of the crucible , for in this way it is better than on the grill  on which one usually puts the crucible , under which the bellows  beat. It is true that the crucible  risks more danger breaking, but you can lute  it as you know founders  do. And also, one ought to maintain the charcoal  between the bellows  & the crucible . Also take heed to cast all at once & not in increments & drop by drop, which would stop & plug up the conduit of the substance. And if make in the cast an abreveoir  to abreuver  the medal, it would be even better.  And so that the substance heats well at the bottom, stir it, once melted, with a wood  stick , for iron  only makes it brittle. Turn.

Some put wool stuffing  in order to heat it & make it run.
 
Put under your crucible , one large iron platte  , which will redden & will maintain the heat under your crucible .

The copper  substance is found to be good for casting, when once broken it makes the grain long & not short, for it demonstrates that it is soft. It is half fine latten  & half red copper . This long grain is called long stalk.

A way for molding excellently with water 

Dissolve in damp place  some tallow of glass , and then place this water  on what you want to mold, having encircled it, and place it to coagulate on the hot ashes . Do the same with vitriol  & copperas , which, once well calcined, reduce in water .


Molding in relief on one part and hollow on the other.

It is necessary to cast two pieces of copper , latten  or similar metal , very neatly, and then when you have molded the cavity in the sand, leave the figure of metal  that you  have molded in the frame , without moving it from its place. And cast, & if there is not enough thickness press a little & push the figure down in the frame .

It is good to mold always the faces not on the side of the cast, but with the head on the bottom, because the force of the substance is at the entry of the medal, & there, where the force is, the filth  & grime  accumulate. And, in this way, if you were mold the face towards the cast, some grime  could be found there, & it is better that is found on the clothing, which is easier to repair.
Vinegar  is better for moistening than wine . It is necessary that the frame  be well smooth and even, otherwise and that the cast be , as you press on one side, the other one lifts.

This is why the press  is better, for it tightens evenly, & more than your hands  , and makes
the lumpy sand , which is damp, communicate its humidity to the soft & fine sand , which is sprinkled & poncé  dry on the medal.

When you mold, always leave your medal in one of the frames , is without stirring it  because, if your cavity is not molded very neatly, you can put it back in the right place by means of pegs , which will prevent it from shifting. But, at first, ponce  yout medal with very fine willow  charcoal , & se   next clean it, for this degreases it, & makes it easier to release.
Do not knock it when molding because this will shake loose the frame  & the sand.

Bellows 
To melt with bellows , & hasten your fonte , & also cast hotter po  , do not place your bellows  at the bottom near the foot of the furnace , for fear that some charcoal  might you  enters it, put them almost under the grille  . It is good that your bellow furnace  be in an aerated place  so that the wind  might make it heat better, & that it be well dry & and reheat. One ought to plug the doors of the furnace  & that there is only entry of the tuelle  of the bellows . And by the end, one ought to give it a good stoking, since at the beginning you will blow gently.

#  & swellings. It is necessary that it not be too wet for the above said reasons. Reheat little by little . And if, after having been molded, you leave it to dry slowly, in some dry place , & not over a big fire, it would be better, for when one exposes it all at once to intense heat, it swells. I believe that reheating it at the mouth of the furnace , after you have taken the bread out , would be well proper. One ought not complain about the difficulty of preparing it, for it withstands as many castings as you wish, because it renders itself hard as marble  & you can polish it & the mold  cannot be spoiled. Having been used, crush & sieve  again, yet without being so scrupulous as to render it very fine, I   for once passed only through a common sieve , it has more force than  and releases better, than when it is so fine.

Sand from a mine in Thoulouse

Try to moisten the crushed glass   and other e   sands with the waters of the above mentioned salts . It wants to be, like all natural sand , well reheated before putting it to work. One pulverises it, because it is in a lump, then one reheats it in a copper  kettle  or similar thing, until it no longer smokes.

It is necessary to reheat it before using it. It is rendered better for casting because it is reheated, but when it has been used a lot, one ought to refresh it with new sand.

 to rest on a very clean & smooth table , & since it is desiccative, I knew it would dry out lor  , what I let it do in order to reduce it to powder, & molding it with sand, once broken up with my fingers   & the sharp edge of a knife .  I oiled  my medal because oil  cleans it without spoiling it. And  And having dried it & cleaned it with a linen  , & small bristle brushes of pork  , I once again lightly oiled  it with clear walnut  oil , & gently passed a linen   over it, so that it does not remain too oiled , and I noted that, in this way, it would come out better in release, because the ceruse , once moistened with water of egg glair , would not attach to the oil . This worked very well and I molded a medal of high relief very neatly, without making any stickiness, which a lot of good sands, such as felt , burnt bone  & iron dross , had failed to do on the first try. I reheated it & my mold  became hard like marble , and I realized with this, that sands for molding high relief should be well moistened with some water , which gives them body & compactness, like egg glair , gummed water , ea  wine boiled with elm root  , & and lightly oil  the medal, it withstands as many castings as you wish, for it is as hard as glass . But even soft lead  & brittle tin v   want to be cast very hot.
Since then I have realized that this sand, even though it is excellent & endures many castings  & molds very neatly, it is however fat and makes things porous. This, soft lead and the  does not come out so well. But try to mix it with a lean sand , such as pumice , flakes , & similar things, to give them body, & so that they release better. For lean sands  barely release well and yet they receive metal  well.

Try to mix ceruse  or minium  with other sands.
X Oil  & smear with aspic  oil , which will go away when reheating, for the oil  makes it porous.

One ought to moisten with glair , then mix it well. And once in the frame , beat it on top with a pestle , or other proper thing, for this makes it mold better and release better. 

It would be good to fill the frame  all at once, for the mixture, made of several sands with the one of the mine  , with which you fill the frame , corrupts it.

Mortars 
They should be of the finest material possible. In the same way , it is better to use copper for a cauldron  than red copper , because it better resists a blow.
The mortars, therefore, used for grinding are stronger & there is less danger of breaking them if they are of fine copper . And for a private home, they do not ring so much & do not make as much noise as those of metal . It is true that those that are of metal  ring louder for apothecaries .
Grenades must be made from fine metal 

Sand from a mine  
It wants to be well reheated for great metals . Some burn it in the furnace  until it is very black, and grind it finely on porphyry  .

 with the substance of a skillet  mixed with a knob that is potin  . And before that, I had so reheated my molded frame , now with the flame of my furnace , now putting lit charcoals  on top of it, that it became almost red. I let it cool and cast. It came out very neatly in relief on one side & in cavity on the other, as well for the figure as the letters. It is true that the material was whitish, as almost metallic, but this was because of the potin  . I made another cast with substance of skillet , alone in the same sand, but not so reheated, it did not come out well.
Since then I molded the bone of oxen  feet, burned, pulverized , & sieved  through a double sieve  & hum  fort   moistened with egg glair  or wine boiled with elm  root . I knocked on it moderately while molding. Having undone the opened the frame , I found that the figures had not released neatly & left the molds  floury-like & crumbling. I les   moistened the bone sand  further, so that it stuck together well in the   between my fingers  , and in this way, I molded neatly with a good release. And even though it seemed to me that the pulverised bone  was lumpy, if there is some substance of skillet  thrown in, my figures came out very neatly. It is true that I had very very reheated my frame , it withstood only one cast. I find  that when a sand is so finely grounded that it renders itself dense as ceruse  & even, like  without knowing it to be arid, rarefied, areneux   & rather spongy, that it molds very neatly, but it does not receive metal  so well, as if it were porous to absorb the substance. But rather, once fat & even, it becomes porous & does not receive fine lines. I believe that the secret  to cast well lies in finding a sand that receives the metal  well, one for lead , the other for another, for each one has its particular one. Let it be molded slowly & scrupulously, and leave it for a few days to become compact by itself, if you have the time for this. And next, reheat it very well not all at once nor over with a large fire, but little by little, otherwise it crumbles & always has some fault. Finally, you ought to cast the copper  or latten  or other great metals  very hot, & if it possible in large quantities of substance, which contain more heat than small quantities. It is necessary that the frame  be cold, & that you cast all at once. Always lute  the entrance of your frame , for the metal , touching iron  or metal ,

Most importantly, make that the cast is always higher than the molded thing, because usually the sand, being reheated, swells & if the par ce   in the middle, & in this way, the molded thing remaining higher than the cast, the metal  cannot run into it easily or enter at all. Also make sure that the mold  & the cast are well reheated. Cast also all at once & out of the wind . And if your medal is really thin, put a card  , or two or three thicknesses of paper   , underneath, when you want to mold it. In this way the mold  will be lower than the cast. Cast also at the place where your medal will be plus es   the least thick & where there will be less relief.

Since then, I molded with burned bone , iron dross  & burned felt , very pulverised & ground finely on marble   and well mixed together. I moistened them very well with beaten egg glair . And having covered the medal with it, as in the others, then filled the frame  with sand from the mine  , I knocked moderately. I found it to be of very good release & molded very neatly. I let it sit all night   long. The next morning , I reheated it little by little, over the course of seven or eight hours  (for if possible, no humidity ought to remain  in the frame ). I cast twice in copper  alloyed with ☾  , as old K  . The substance came very beautiful, shiny, & sonorous , & without a chappe , and my sand was not corrupted at all.  Since then, I have cast with it several casts of soft lead  & tin , that came out better & more neatly than any other that I have ever found.
When you mold, make certain lines around your mold , in the frame , in order to attract the substance to all sides, in this way.
 Potin  from seringue   & other co  works, runs even better than fine latten .  But I think that it is better half copper  & half latten , which have been used & have been in very thin works, such as skillets & other similar things. I have this mixture of half  and half  come out well.

 In order to mold well, one ought in a big frame  several medals together, for when there is a lot of substance, & the crucible  is almost full, it heats more, & then, if one medal does not come out well, the other will be good.
It is better to melt in a bellows furnace  than in a four à vent  , because it gives a more vigorous heat. It is true that latten  melts well in the four à vent  , because it is easier to melt than copper , being more brittle.
Some of the founders   have this superstition, that only three days a week  are good for melting, namely Tuesdays , Wednesdays  Thursdays , and Saturdays . The others, for them, are unlucky.
When you mold, do not knock excessively on the medal, which is in the sand, because it prevents it from releasing very neatly, & shakes loose the mold .
Take heed also that the sand does not surpass the edges of the frame , for it makes the molded medal higher than the cast, & in this way, metal  will never enter the mold. Therefore, always make sure that the surface of your casted object directly lines up with the mold , and to make this effect, if you wish, put a lump of carton    of whatever thickness you wish.
Founders  , in order to prevent their large cast works from becoming porous, are careful to well reheat their molds. And to know if they have been reheated enough, they knock against it with their finger  , & if they ring  like a pot, then they are.
To cast their canons neatly, they  mix their earth  with some fine casting sand , if they can get any.

Sand from the mine  of Thoulouse  
 Casting sand coming from the mine , once passed through a double sieve , next put in with melted resin , burns & inflames & becomes all red & inflamed like iron . Once cold it is completely black and can be ground very finely on porphyry  . Thus having prepared it & render it without asperity on the fingernail  , I moistened it with beaten egg glair  & beat it well, until it was not pasty but rather powdery. I found it of very good release, & molded with it in lead  & tin  very neatly, but it wants to be well reheated & at ease.
Others beat it well in a mortar , in small amounts at a time, & thus it detaches and renders very finely. Then they reheat it moderately, only to dry it. Then they grind it dry on porphyry  . And thus it becomes as if impalpable, and not too dried out,  it  and it retains body & bond of the earth  of which it is related, and is better than when it is very burnt. Once moistened with egg glair wiped with a sponge  , it releases very neatly M   very neatly in low relief, but not for figures in high relief. Therefore, since then I experimented lexper   with moistening it only with very strong vinegar . It released a figure which I could not release previously. And I believe that, moistening the finest in the same way like with glair   &  the lumpiest, to fill the chasses  with salt water  or wine , that they do not ally so well. Since they are of the same nature & are moistened the same, they embrace each other, & hold together one with the other.
To mold well , after having prepared your sands, mold in a day . Slowly reheat them the next day , then cast them on another.

Mineral sand
It does not matter if the color is white or yellow. Above all it must be in one piece, & as if taken from a quarry  or rock formation , & the deeper one takes it from, the better. The signs of its goodness is that it is thus amassed, and that when removing in the form of rock , it comes out in lumps & qu   pieces which demonstrates its bond, & that it is not too lean.
However, it should break apart between your hands    & have very small men   & delicate grains & of the same nature. If it is not delicate enough, you can pass & grind it finely, either through water , or through a sieve , & when it  or on the porphyry  , & in this way, from sil   leanness they become fat & well bound. You can mold with it in a sa  frame  or in a noyau  without cloth waste , & try it with lead , for if with this one it does not become porous & casts neatly, it will also behave well with copper . Some say that the fat sands  do not want the metal  to be cast too hot. Artisans who work on big works  & to save time, do not need to grind & seek the curiosities of artificial sands , benefit from seeking some ready made in nature , which has the finest grain possible, & for small works, they only pass it only through a sieve . But those who work in small works, finely grind it  & grind it impalpable, because they do not need a lot of it.

Take heed that it does not stay for too long, for it would become so wet  that it would not be good for molding in a frame , but rather in a noyau , in which you will be able to use it well as long as dries well at ease & far from the fire. Otherwise the heat makes it swell, & push the salt  onto the surface, which renders it lumpy. You can in  smear the medal with spike lavender  oil , molding in noyau . It is better to put in 4 ℥   of sal ammoniac  per lb , and moisten it in a damp place  for two or three days  , & so that when you take fistfuls , it holds together, without, however, attaching itself & being pasted to your hand  . You will with it mold very neatly. But let it dry & reheat really well, leaving the mold  inside, so that it acquires strength by reheating, for it becomes hard as stone , & and in this way is more certain to release well. Otherwise if you release before having reheated it, there would be danger of it crumbling in some place, because of its delicateness & fineness, even if the medal of high relief.  Once you have molded with it, pulverize it as before and put it back in dampness .

All sand that releases well has body & sticks well. Ammoniac  is fat and a va   however, is areneux   which makes it release well. There is no better bond than salts appropriate for metals , for once mixed in powder, they get moistened together & dry &reheat together.

Glassmaker 's white sand from the mine  , mixed with sal ammoniac 
There is found in Cominge , near the town  of Aurignac , a sand, white mai  , like salt , and lean, that glassmakers  & potters  use, which renders impalpable crushed on  porphyry   & is easy to crush. And once crushed, it resembles calcined alabaster . It molds very neatly, and I have not found any that molds as delicately as this one for low relief. It is excellent to mold en noyau  without a frame, having crushed it impalpable with gummed or pure water  on porphyry  , then placing it, thick as mustard  or a little more, on the medal, smeared with a oil either olive , walnut , even better spike lavender  . But to do it better mo  , let it dry by itself, without fire, for one or two days  . Although, if you are in a hurry, you can heat it well, & it will not crack, if it is not put on too lightly. It is true, being thus suddenly exposed to heat all at once, it makes some holes & bubbles, which it does not do when dried in the cold or at ease, rather than being reheated. Once dry, reheat it & it will withstand several casts.

Sal ammoniac  and iron dross 
I have pulverized sal ammoniac , well dried in the fire & in a hot bronze  mortar , and passed it through the double sieve , it became very fine. But to render it even thinner, I have crushed it dry on porphyry  . Then I mixed it with pulverized & finely ground iron dross , in the same way, and both mold very neatly things in low relief, without being moistened in the serain   , or in the cellar , or otherwise with the napkin , &  it releases very neatly.

Sand
Molders  from Foix  who cast their medals from the side, use crocum ferri   and calcined slate . It is for very flat things.

All sands can be rendered good
Artisans who work in big works , & who need to further their profit, by seeking things already prepared in nature, because it does not sell its wares to people, and to also save the time they would use for grinding finely & and for artificially preparing sands, seek the one of the s  mine s  , which is not too fat, having some earth  in it, not too lean & consequently without bond, but rather which is pulled from the depths of the sand-bed  in mattons  & clods that show its natural compactness, which is quite difficult to break & which has a very small & delicate grain, & which is found soft when handling it between your fingers   . And because the latter is only found near the rocks in mountainous areas , or lean territories  & having arene  , it cannot be found in in the surroundings of all the bonnes villes   , where artisans  willingly gather themselves.  And thus, if they do not have it close to their house , they prefer to have it come from afar, like from Lyon , Venise , Parys near the Sainct Chappelle  & similar places, rather than prepare it. However, you can be certain that in all places you can render the sand from the mine  .

 good & proper for molding. For if it is big, pass it through a sieve , and if it is not yet fine enough, wash it, & when the water  will be a little rested, empty the one which is still troubled in some separate vessel . The big ones will fall down quickly to the bottom of the first vessel , but the one which will have come from the troubled water , placed separately, having taken residence, will be very fine. And then, if it does not have enough bond, grind it well dry on porphyry  , & you will render it impalpable, & which will have bond just like chalk . Then, if it seems to need it, you will reheat it, & will crush it again & mix it with salts , or linen, or  burned felt  or ashes of paper  & similarly washed things.

Terre fondue  of potters  
Grind it in a mortar  mustard mill   with some water , &  and render it impalpable, dry it & next moisten it with salt water , which gives strength to u   all sands to withstands several casts.

Orange trees
In Italy, particularly  in the coldest areas like Lombardia, people plant the orange trees inside squared wood  planters. The planters are larger at the bottom than at the top. People make handles on each side, where they attach straps in order to carry the planter, like one carries the gout sufferers, because if one used wheels to roll them one would damage the garden's paths. Every two year they remember to open the sides of the planters and meticulously cut & trim the ends of the orange tree's roots, which are dry. Otherwise, the roots find the wood of the planter , tighten on it & they double over themselves & the ends dry & the tree dies. Once trimmed, the roots gain new space   to expand, without encountering resistance from the wood of the planter . That is why it is better to join the sides of the planter with screws & not with nails, to avoid shaking the soil  when one opens them.

 091r
Grafting
Any tree that has a large pith will be hard to be  graft from, because the cutting is difficult to remove.  If the pith is damaged, the graft will take in an unstraight manner, like with vines of all peach and apricot trees.
Apricot trees have a very thin bark , and so it is necessary to graft them onto young trees whose own bark  is not thick yet, such as the young shoots of prune trees or apricot trees.
The graft will not take if the cutting gets wet.  It is necessary therefore to graft in serein and mild weather, not too cold and not too windy.
One must use old wood  to graft, if one wants to graft on a tree that is already mature and quite big; because if this is the case, it will compress the cutting, and if the cutting is of young wood , it will not grow properly. But old wood  resists the compression of old wood  better than the young , because it is harder than young wood . But if the graft is done with only old wood , it will never grow beautifully, but will be frail and short and will take a long time to grow.

Molding with cuttlefish  bone  
Guard against keeping them in a damp place , for they are well prone to getting moist. If your medal is small, cut the bone  in two then even it out with a knife . And on a hooked rooftile  , well dry &well smooth & covered with pulverized willow  charcoal , rub & smooth the two half bones  . Thus they absorb this willow  charcoal , which makes them release them, guard against removing anything. Then on a counter bone , that is to say a lump of brick , smoothed to the size of your bone  , place your medal,  & then on this one, place the bone  ,  & press well with some other piece of the same size above. And for the second time, mold it, but before, ponce  on top with  willow  charcoal  & blow gently, then press as before, and it will come out neatly. If it is for a spoon handle, one needs two whole bones  .  All cast work is brittle & subject to breaking, because the metal  expands when cast, & retracts & condenses when hammered . That is why, one ought to retrace the cast thing with a chisel , & in this way the metal  retracts, and let it thus escrouir .  If the piece for molding is of high relief, first trace the mold  & the cavity with a pen-knife , to make way for the medal & then mold. And if the medal has two sides
Before casting, heat the bones   in order to make them lose only the coldness & dampness.
When the lead  gets too hot, it calcines.
 
 091v
 since the two bones   are joined, co   cut them evenly all around, & make notches e   around it in different places which cross over the joining of the two bones  , in order to recognize well the place of the first joining. Or else, with little shards of wood  , pierce them, or ma   coat the joinings with some clay , & dry. Press between them  your hands  joined between your two  knees ;  & not with a press , because the bones   would burst. Mold also at your leisure & two or three times, until you see that it is well pressed tightly together & well imprinted.  And each time before replacing the piece, ponce  with some willow  charcoal , for it makes it release well.  When you have cast, rub the medal with oil  & with willow  charcoal powder  & with a brush , to make it dull.  Guard against your medal being too greasy or oily , when you mold in cuttlefish  bone  . When you have cast, leave it to cool before taking the medal out, for when one takes it out hot, it brings with it some bone  . And, cast moderately hot, something you will know when the bone   is about to change its good  whiteness. But when it is too hot, it really waxes the bone   red. The proportion  of lead  & tin  is as much one as the other. If the piece is difficult to come out, & of several pieces, make the cast forked with three or four grooves, and make  & direct these grooves to the place of thickest parts. Also make these grooves around the medal, like directly on the head, for this attracts the metal  & absorbs the figure best.  Shake your frame  a little when you have cast, and thus you will make very neatly several casts. Tin  that is too hot burns the bone  , which is corrupted. Also, once taken out du mo  hot from the mold , it risks breaking.

Sand Mixture easy to melt
One ℥  de  part soft tin , one part fine lead , one part looking glass tin  & one part argent vif arresté   makes an alloy & a solder , so easy to melt that it can easily be melted in a dish of fine tin  .

Molding a cavity on one side and in relief on the other
And for this effect, one casts a medal of fine tin , which is harder to melt. And since it is neat, one molds with it. And one leaves it in one half of the frame , & presses it a little so that it holds better. And next, you will cast in your frame  some solder  described above, or another more meltable than fine tin . And thus, the second medal will melt & mold itself on the first one without spoiling it. But to make sure this is done right, mix some lamp black  with water , & with a pinceau  , give a light coat of this to the medal, which remains in the frame , & leave to dry. Thus it will not melt.
But if you have a medal of copper  or silver , you can leave it in the cast, if you want to cast with lead  or tin . But it is necessary that it be a little hot, for the cold would make the tin  contract.
Tin  wants to be cast quite hot to come out neat.
Soft tin  , which is the best for the cast, is the one that, once cast en grille  , is burnished &  shiny & polished like a mirror, & appears to have been burnished. And has have holes like the one that is brittle, & that is not shiny, as if burnished.

Potin 
Potin , once cast hot, runs & flows like tin . But the medal becomes whitish from this, and immediately pushes the verd   to the surface, which good substances do not do.

Sand from river tellins  and mussels  
 The long shells   that can be found in fresh river waters , once calcined, makes an impalpable white sand, which moulds very neatly.

Freezing  mercury 
It freezes, just as I tried, by boiling it one or two hours   in a rather large iron  posnet , putting in, for an ℥   of ☿  , ii  ℥   of  verdet  de   and  vitriol of saltpetre , ana  , with sufficient quantity of old water from mareschaulx   .
Or else, melt 4 ℥   of tin , & as it cools, purify it of its filth , which is on top, then, make a hole in it & put in there i ℥   of ☿   & it will come out like tin  if you remelt it, but it will be breakable. And If you want to assay if it is tin  or ☿  , redden a shovel  & put a small lump of your ingot on top. If it is tin , it will melt & stay, but if it is ☿  ,  will quickly melt, then when crackling well, it will evaporate. One ought to freeze it in a spoon  or in a hollow crucible , & make a moderately sized hole.
It can also be frozen, as I assayed, in aqua fortis   which beforehand will have eaten a little silver . This one, mixed, makes tin  & lead  run.

Mixture
Fine tin , frozen mercury  with the smell of tin , looking glass tin , fine lead , as much of one as the other , makes a substance that melts very quickly, but breakable & white. I think that it would be good for solder . A long time to cool.

Olives
The olives go bad if you do not refresh their salt water  once a month, do not touch it with your hands, otherwise they will go bad.

Country folk's observation
When it freezes on Palm Sunday, it will freeze every month of the year
When the first flowers fall because of the frost, the other flowers also start perish.

Grafts
Do not use a graft from old wood , because it never makes a beautiful tree.
Leave only two shoots on the graft and no more, otherwise it will become weaker. The wind torments it and leaves it strengthless to propagate by cuttings.
Trees which have big pith, such as peach trees, and all other trees of their kind, and the plum trees, can't be grafted when freezing because the cold damages their pith, which also has to be protected avoiding to cut the bottom of the graft.
All grafts must not be done earlier than the sap flows up, otherwise they dry.

Sand
The white ash of all woods , which still sticks to the wood  that burns, and which has not fallen into the bo  hearth  , molds very neatly.

Sand
Ashes  well pulverized tallow  molds & releases very neatly. The one from the kitchens , which is fat & shiny, from the big kitchens , is better.
Finely pulverized quicklime  works.  The same for broken up flint ,which works better in the cavity.

Faces in distemper 
Because colors in distemper  dry quickly & one would not have leisure to perfect the shadows & touches on the face, one wets the reverse of the face which is on canvas  with a wet sponge . Then, with a small pinceau  , one makes the shadows, which do not come undone. Next, one lays the flesh color, which does not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And again with a more lively flesh color, one touches the more prominent areas. And with another pinceau   one does the shadows again  by hatching. The shadow strokes do not come undone because they are made of bistre , which stains the canvas  like rust . The said bistre  is good with  for making shadows in distemper mix , for in oil  it has no body & would not dry but with great difficulty. One mixes in the said bistre , for shadow, ocre de ru   & a little  sap green . The best bistre  is the greasy & shiny kind from the fireplaces of large kitchens . It is difficult to grind & screeches on the marble  .

Azure 
Azur d’esmail   always wants to be cleaned because the filth that can be seen in the laveures  makes it die. One needs to coat it two times, & the first very thick, moving the pinceau   by laying it first lengthwise then across.   It is better used on canvas , where it is imbibed immediately, than on wood . Varnish  returns it to its vigor, because being imbibed, it becomes dark. To try it, painters  bring their palette  to the grocers , & distemper & alloy it with a little white ground in oil , for in this way, the beautiful shows its turquine  vivacity, but the bad is lavender grey. The most delicate is the best for working. It is thinned working  by washing it.

Violet and lake 
It is made of azure  & lake  which is also assayed on the palette  with white. It is deemed beautiful that which which, on a polished knife  or on glass   gives a clear red  color of red rose, tending a little towards violet. The kind which is blac  dark red is not as pleasant.

Burnisher 
The different parts of a sword are the handle, and  the sheath of the sword. What comes next is the heel. The rest is the blade. The sides are the edge and the point. Certain blades, acute in point, have only one side filed in the middle & along the whole length, and are easy to break. Other blades are called of three molds or three grips, which have one good rise in the middle, but this elevation is flat as if it were acute in point but flattened. These ones are most certain. Others are called fluted, which are notched from the middle, & when it is along the whole length, they are just as easy to break as those acute in point and are more troublesome to burnish because the burnishing stick can't get in. But they make one specially that is narrow.
Making up the hilt of the sword are the pommel, the branches of the hilt and the cross-guard, which is this iron  strip that closes off the guard and  that is at the end of the heel to stop thrusts from sliding down the hilt. The rings are these two branches in half round that start from the eye of the guard and go all the way to the branch of the cross-guard.  The branch that crosses the hilt is called the body and this escutcheon, by which the sword enters the sheath and to which all the branches return, and which holds them, is called the eye of the guard.
Following is the wood  of the grip which one glue s or more fittingly uses  some mingled wax  which is made of wax  and pitch , for rosin  would be too hard. He heats it lightly, then rubs the wood  of the grip so that the tang takes hold, or the threads , otherwise, when a thread  frays off, the whole thing will break all at once. With iron  thread or dog skin , one also uses glue . The trimming set on the wood , which is made of silk  or thread , is called the cord, which is made from two or three threads  twined on the spinning wheel, or 4 if the silk  is thin. A cord a little bigger holds better. The rivements, which are also made of silk  at both ends of the grip, are called the buttons.
Some grips are made of silk , seal skin , iron  thread reheated with gold  and fine and false silver  thread & velvet thread . Iron  thread is of less price and is most durable. Next is that of silk , if one does not have the convenience of being close to the sea in order to recover some dog skin , which is quite convenient. The good skin  costs fifty or lx sous  and makes 4 or five dozen grips. This one gives a good grip and a sure hand. To put it to work, if it is too hard, soak it for one or two hours in slightly lukewarm aqua fortis . Because if it were too hot, it would boil and spoil the skin . It is sewn with black thread .
  
 94v
 The gold  handles are made with some yellow thin cloth  set below or other kind of chalk-yellowed fabric . And this cloth  is set on with glue  or aforesaid gum . This is in order to make the thread  hold better on it. These latter are made of cordons like the silk  ones and between two cordons are put one or two threads  to enhance it. The silver  one is identically made. And there is as much difficulty as for the silk  one, not because silk  is difficult to twisted, but it needs to be twisted twice. A fine gold  handle is worth 28 or 20 cents.
The best sword point is of sage foliage .
This long stick on which the sword is laid down and attached in order to furbish is called the chameau. It is commonly made from rowan  which is hard and even.
The stick underneath which is folded bow-like is called the arch.
The stick above is called stick of the fustée.
And this square piece, used on the sword to burnish it, is called the fustée.
There are two horns, one is called the oil  hornet and the other the emery  hornet. 
There is an iron  tool with the shape of a halberd point, square and made of very even and well limed steel  called the grateau which helps to soften lime strokes on swords hilts and to sharpen blades once they are softened which is better than with stone  or other tools which leave some scratches.
To make the swords cut better, the edge from the point is also sharpened.
Those who create sword hilts  are different craftsmen than furbishers .
The fustée is a three-finger-thick, square wood  tool, made of boxwood  which fit in the middle of the fustée stick to furbish.
The fresil stick is made of willow wood  which is to …  weapon with some clinker  which is the iron scale  falling from the blacksmiths ' forge.

 The furbisher  buys his blades by the dozen which are not finished, but ready  to be pulled from their  sheaths since he does this himself in order to add them well at the pommels and guards.
Spanish swords are esteemed to be better for they are of better steel  and iron  but they are not as well-forged as Vienna swords, in Dauphiné. The Spanish ones are not as well sharpened from the forge since they sharpen them with their feet and this is what makes them wavy.
Vienna blades cost commonly Xviii or 19 lb.
The first thing the furbisher  does to his new blades is to draw them out from the sheath, which he does himself or has it done by locksmiths  or blacksmiths  to whom he gives some liart for their charcoal . Afterwards they pass it over a grindstone to cut it down. Then they lay it down on the chameau,  and with some powdered emery , fine and soft as flour, and soaked with oil  to make it take, they polish the sword with the stick used to take off the tracks left by the grindstone and then they clean the blade well with the emery . And they add a drop or two of oil  spread with the finger to give it luster. Once the oil  is applied, they polish it again on the chameau with the "felin" which is a thunderstone mounted on the middle of a stick like the "fustée." And this stick is called the "felindel" stick. Once they used the "felin," they polish it again with some chalk  and the oil already  on the sword. After they follow this and going over it again, they polish it with dry chalk . Finally when they are finished with mounting of the pommel and guard , they give it a sharp edge with a file. They then dry it and sharpen it and furbish it again with some dry chalk . At the end when they are completed and mounted, they give it the blade  a sharp edge with a grater.
They are polished on a false mounting with the guards which are present in order to find out if they work well together. And employing a blade of the sort of which all the sizes should be made in the hand, one conjectures whether it will be as strong when mounted.
One puts the blade in a vice between two pieces of wood , then with a file, they enlarge it  if needed for attaching the guard. Then to clench it, one positions the place to be riveted and the pommel on a piece of wood . And with a hammer, one beats on the top to make it very level and to secure the pommel. Then with the hammer, one finishes the rivet when the hammer is well secured and does not shake. The wood  is placed so as not to put gashes in the pommel. Afterwards one makes a place for the rivet with a file or chisel. And some make the rivet or attachment  in a diamond-shape but this is not as good as a round topped one  because one cuts oneself on the corner of the rivet.

 The end can be bought already made, a dozen of small ones costs six sols but the big ones 2 carolii.The end is fixed either with nails which are fixed on the sides of the cutting edge, but this only spoils the sword and rots the scabbard for the water goes into it via the juncture of the nail. The best way is to apply some resin  or glue  but the resin  is better. And the best is when the end is tightly set and so hot when set that powdered resin  on the end melts, in that way it doesn't fall and can't be undone unless it is put in fire.
Hilts are of different types:
Ornate
Guttered which is with round mouldings
Pearled 
Scarfed when the bands are crosswise
Onioned which is with a flat head
In the King's manner, fully covered 
The furbishers  buy them by dozens, the dozen of full ones costs 10 lb. the worked one, 30 sols or more  depending on its nature.
The first thing that the apprentice  does is to furbish as said.
And then to adorn the sword and make a scabbard which is the summum of the art.
They buy scabbards' wood  pieces which are wholly made of beech wood , a hundred for 15 or 20 or 30 sols, depending on how far they are made.
Theses wood  pieces are thus called estelles, and have to be very clean and without any knots and are one finger thick.
Then the furbisher  puts them on a small bench, called a scabbard bench and with a small iron  tool similar to the joiners ' bench, they maintain it firmly.  Then with a plane, which is like a two-handled knife, they work the wood  piece from the top, then use the joyner 's plane to flatten it more. Afterwards, the inside is scoured with a
 
 096r
 
round plane , also two-handed, and then with a small narrow plane , it is gutted and scoured for half a foot towards the end of the heel. And a shorter scouring is better so that the sword does not always cut the scabbard.

The opening of the scabbard is called the mouth and on top of it is the shape of the knife.

The stitch which is a leather  rim set on the edge of the knife shape is made to stop the sword frogs.

When the small planks are well flattened, the sword is laid down on them and with a black stone  one marks the width and length of the blade. Then with a chisel  the excess is cut. And a plane  is used to even properly following the marks.

Then the two small planks are stuck edge to edge and all around  only following the knife shape and not elsewhere. And this is to make the scabbard velvet leather  hold.

Then the sword is put in the small planks and it is set in the scabbard which is sewed. And they rub what is glued directly on the knife shape with some tallow  to run into the scabbard.

The scabbard is made of calf  or sheep leather , the calf  ones are in all one piece, but not the sheep  ones. When swords are long, they are made of several patches sewn between leather  and flesh  and then they rub firmly the stitching with a boxwood  piece to cover and even it. From a good calf skin , 8 or  9 or 10 scabbards can be made. A workman  can easily make 6  a day. If they are too thick, they are lightly thinned out with a plane. If the skin  is too hard, it is lightly dipped in some lukewarm water  but not for long. Next, the same worker who worked wood  piece has to adjust the scabbard in order for it to be well done. It is true that for common people, there are some good already all made, but they never fit perfectly. When the scabbard is made and sewed with black thread , it is rubbed with a boxwood  piece or a slightly oiled  cloth . The good cow leather  scabbard is the best of all and costs also more than all except the velvet  ones. Under the velvet  one usually put plain canvas  or a sheep skin  scabbard or a parchment  layer. But the best scabbard is a waxed scabbard covered with either velvet  or calf skin . One covers the wood with thin canvas, which one then waxes, and covers in velour  or calf skin . A waxed  scabbard is worth at least 30 cents, a cow  leather one, 20 cents.

Grey hilts
When they are white, it is necessary only to clean them well, and then to heat them over a fire, and make them turn blue. And take good care that they do not turn too blue, since neither gold  nor silver  nor any color would set. To accomplish this, which is called les faire passer , have a caldron full of ashes  that you cover with some blazing hot charcoal , and heat the ashes  thus very well, for an hour or two. And when the ashes  are very hot, put the charcoal  aside and put the hilt where the charcoal  was, and cover it completely with ashes . And when the body, which is the main part of the hilt, is completely colored, flip it onto the other side. In that way, the grey cannot color it too dark, unless some hot coal  touches it. Greying can be achieved in an ordinary fireplace, too, but there is a danger that it may sit there too long and make a crust which which will prevent the color from setting. Blue coloring is obtained as soon as the ashes  have heated the hilts a little bit, but it will always be grey on some sides. After blue comes grey.

Color of water
For  the color of water, pass a lime doulce   on the guards to whiten them, then the burnisher . Next, one makes them pass blue until they become grey. Next, when they are still moderately hot, pass the bloodstone  over them, and when they cool, one turns them to reheat them, for the color of water is made only by several goes. And if the guards were not warm, the bloodstone  would scrape & undo the color. One needs to heed that guards do not pass too grey, for they would give off filth that would prevent the color from taking. One needs almost one day   for preparing, softening, & setting the color of water, but as they pass a little blue, it is enough for grey & another color. Grey is the lesser color after varnish  which is of two colors, either yellow or black.

Yellow varnish 
One whitens very well & one cleans the guards well. Next, one with a feather, one coats them cold with a feather  all of walnut olive   oil , and next turn them over a good charcoal  fire that is in the furbishers ' furnace , without them touching the charcoal  or the ashes . And when they do not smoke anymore, it is done.

Black varnish 
It is said, at the beginning of the book where you can see it, that it is made with  galipot .


Gilding
One prepares the guards thoroughly with a soft, very soft file  such that there is nothing black left on any of the guards, and next heat them, & pass them as said. But to gild & gild with silver , they ought not to pass, except maybe a little towards blue. Then while the guards are hot, one attaches them to a wood block & with some tweezers  one layers the gold  & one makes it sit with bloodstone ,which is quite clean & rubbed with pottée  . And when the guards are cold, one reheats them, then one layers the gold  as above. And first one gives de   two layers, until the entire guard is well-adorned. And next one reheats as at the beginning, & one gives the third covering of gold . Then one burnishes very thoroughly and with great force with a large bloodstone . And  But note that to  burnish well, the guard always needs to be warm. And to know this, one smells it & brings it close to the nose  . For one ought not to touch with the fingers , but one grasps  picks it up from on top of the warm ashes  with a small iron  rod , which has been purposely made to go into the eye of the guard. And when it is entirely well-polished, one rubs it very well with a white linen  , and the gold  needs to be thicker & stronger than for painters . A quarter  is worth fifty or LX sols  .

Gilding with silver 
One needs to prepare the guards & whiten them with a lince   file , a little coarser for  than for gold .  And one makes them pass to grey, as for gilding. And when they are warm, one needs to double the leaf of silver , then divide it with a knife , next cover the guard with it, with un petit  tweezers  & a small burnisher . And then reheat & apply them, until they are all gilded in silver . Next one needs to cover them for the third time, with the leaf  doubled as has been said, then burnish them very strongly & with good strength, not with the bloodstone , but with a strong burnisher , just as the burnisher  ought not to burnish gold .

Mastic varnish  dry in a half hour  

Some take 2 ℥   of mastic , half ℥   of turpentine  & half ℥   of turpentine oil  & eau de vye , a little at your discretion, because it evaporates when heated & nonetheless makes the varnish  more desiccative. But I made it thus: I take turpentine oil  at  discretion & put in a good bit of turpentine , because it remains always moist & attaches itself if one puts in too much, & eau de vye , & heat in a varnished bowl  the said oil , & when it begins to be very hot, I put in some subtly ground mastic  & around one-third  of the oil  passed through a sieve l , and let reheat until it is melted, which will be soon on hot ashes . Once all melted, try it on the knife , and if you see that it has too much body, add in a little turpentine oil , and if it does not have enough, add in mastic , and thus it well be done. And keep it well covered so that no filth gets in. When you want to make it, be careful to sort & choose the mastic  that is white & purified of any dirt & dust & black dross. And when you wash it & dry it to render it very white & clean, it will be even better. For if you do not purge it well, these straws   & marks, pulverised into it, will remain within the varnish , & when you set it on white or carnation, it will appear that they are fleas  & blemishes. Once well chosen, pulverise it in a mortar  and pass it through a very fine sieve , and next mix it in oil , as is said. But if you want to make it more carefully, extract a tear of mastic , as you know, pulverise, pass, & mix, and you will have something very singular for small works. Take heed when varnishing not to breathe on it, for this will make the varnish  whiten & take body.

It almost dries when working.

One knows that this varnish  does not have body enough when it does not take well on a panel in oil  for it is like water . Add in therefore pulverized mastic  & heat until it is good. This varnish  is very white & beautiful, & does not go to your head like that of spike lavender  .

For some, instead of tour  turpentine oil , put spike lavender  oil , which is not as good.

This varnish  is laid down cold on the panel with a very clean fingertip  , & one needs to spread it vigorously.

The Italians  scarcely varnish their paintings because they lay their paintings very thick & they are a long time  drying on the inside, though on top they make a dry skin & crust.

One lays the varnish  with a finger   so as to lay it thin, because when thick, it yellows.

To work nearby

It is a strange thing that the workers in this craft can only work if they have good breath, for if they have bad breath their work will crack when refired.

Varnish  for lutes
They take a little turpentine  & oil of turpentine or of spike lavender   &  amber pulverized  & passed very subtly & make as that of mastic , & add in to color it a little dragon 's blood  and make it reddish, and others some terra merita   for yellow.

Borders for a Garden
You have to work the ground, then then it with a rake, and afterwards if it is dry you must wet  it. Then stretch a cord clean on the ground, and along its length hit the cord with the back of a pruning knife, so that the cord marks a right line. Along its length you will make holes with an iron  stake, where you will plant rosemary, its head lopped off & cut to measure and thinned out at the foot.

Locksmith 
To well tin  nails and other work, they file  their work very neatly. Then to clean it well & rid it of fattiness, they make it boil in vinegar , then they wipe it well with a linen   . Next they heat it & pass some resin  over top, which coats it with a shiny skin like varnish . This done, they melt some pure & fine tin  in their estamiere , which is a little square iron  box. And when the tin  is well melted & moderately warm, they throw in  resin  in to burn the filth, & then they let the head of a nail  or something similar soak a little, & having remained there for seven or eight pauses  , they take it out and shake it, hitting the top with an iron   to make the tin  that is superfluous fall off, & clean it with a small stick wrapped in tow  . And if it is not well tinned , you will hit it hot with a piece of resin  & do as before & let it cool. When the work cools, it becomes yellow, which is a sign that the tin  is the right temperature. But it becomes blue if the tin  is too hot. Things t   thus tinned  are durable & are not undone like tinning done in leaf , thus at the end of a year  they can be clarified & renewed by heating & rubbing them.
Leadsmiths  say that making a lizard  die in the melted il des  tin  makes the tinning  become very golden. Or else putting in sal ammoniac .

Small dogs
Small barbet dogs are recognizable thanks to their muzzle which is larger than that of other dogs.

Salted artichokes 
One should put them fill and not too ripe in a small barrel full of brine . Then can be served all year long, with salads, oil  and vinegar , raw, as prepared in this way they take long to cook. Make sure to try your brine  with an egg : if it is good, the egg  will float in it. If it does not float, it means the brine   is not strong enough and would not conserve the fruits .

Trees
Those which carry fruits  age early and do not last long.

Birds
Those who have been fed at the spit do not sing among or the company of other birds, they do only when they have their own cage. To teach them to sing well, they have to be taken from their nest as young as possible, and be covered with a duvet  or rabbit skin . That way, having not seen their father and known their voice, they learn better to sing the way they are taught to.

Fonte 
The potée   is made of burnt earth  which was used in the fonte , this is earth bourre bolvene   in which one has melted it. One grinds it on a big stone  , & with this one one makes the chappe  of  first coat of the chappe  of bells, where there are letters & works, & le   only needs to be reheated in the flame of a straw , and mold very neatly.
The earth  which molds in noyau  is subject to making it porous, if you do not rub well with a brush  or your finger   on the molded piece, which should be well oiled . And do it coat by coat, & not all at once.

 Earth , or sand, moistened or ground with water , wants to be reheated more than sand.
Latten from a candlestick  is not pure, for one mixes in it iron filings  & potin .
Latten  wants to be cast hotter than copper , quod non credo .
One ought not, to cast carefully, to take metals already alloyed , but take them pure & mix them.
Iron  hardly agrees with being cast in a mixture of copper  or latten .
It is better all with a sand, either in a frame  or noyau  at once, rather than several mixed.


One ought to reheat for one or two hours  et p  , in that a charcoal  fire which lights by itself, a crucible  with the substance inside, and then blow & cover the crucible  with large charcoals  & the mouth of the furnace  with bricks  , and let it consume two or three feedings of charcoal , which se   fill the furnace  above the crucible . In the end feed and stoke the fire, & when the flame is very white & that the substance will be in a liquid bain  like water  & casting off  pale blue flames, cast. The secret is to cast very  hot & in one go.

Lean white sand 
Without bond renders well proper for casting, & having body, if you grind it very finely on porphyry   or calcine it, reddening it several times in the fire, & being in vinegar , or finely ground with water  as you know, it also molds very neatly in noyau , as I have experimented. But do not moisten it with salt water  if you want to quickly reheat it, for salt  boils on the fire & makes bubbles, being pressed by the fire. I believe that the noyau , gently reheated, would not do this. I molded very neatly in noyau  the substance of skillets .  White sand smells like sulphur   when reheated, and I believe it would melt. And since the substance has been cast in it, it acquires in the mold comm e   a luster as if it were leaded  or vitrified. I believe that glassmakers  could use it.


One needs very little of sal ammoniac  dissolved in water .

Bell handles

They can be put back on, without remaking the bell, which one ought to put back in the pit, & and mold it there. But should you solder  a ref   cracked bell, it is considered impossible to give it its first voice.

Quince trees
They have to be pruned often; otherwise they die and do not produce good fruit.

Cannons
They are very difficult to drill when they are made of metal  since the material is rough and brittle. But you must not push the drill too strongly or push all at once, but remove it often. In that case, the cannon mouth is bigger than the bullet in order to avoid drilling, since the material can be easily cast and slides. The drill should not be like a dovetail, or a point, but should be cut in round like a crankshaft. If it breaks, don't leave it to rust + 
+  but instantly take it off from the light. What you will do is pour a little oil  on it and then turn it down opposite to the light, strike the opposite side, and it will fall out. You have to drill gently when a piece is made of metal.

Bells
One does not make them in the pit if they do not fit.

Gilding your  molding for panels without gold 
Some take orpiment in leaf form  & pulverize it & make moresque  leaves & burnish it, and it is this orpiment  which is shiny like gold . However, ground metals  or ground cristallin   or touchstone  are better.

Orpiment  orange
One sublimates it & one grinds it & some put in a little arsenic  to make it melt instead.

Varnish 
Some make this of mastic  with two ounces  of mastic  and one of clear & white turpentine oil  & eau de vye  as above. Heat it on ashes  until it is melted, then let it rest & put it in another vessel  to purge it of dregs.

Gold color
To quickly make a layer of or sur   mat   on canvas  or  other oil panel , one makes fatty walnut  oil in the sun  or on the fire , as said above, for it thickens by itself in this way, although there is neither lead , nor ceruse . And with this, grind massicot  , mine , & other desiccatives, not verdet   nor orpiment , for they cause the gold  to die. It will be dry soon. However, if the weather is not clear & dry  , do not shade it, for if the weather is damp & humid  , it would turn black.

Portrait-painting from nature
One needs to carefully observe  the eyes, the nose, & the beard, for these three things make strong resemblance.

Gemstones 
One needs to pound your materials in a thick glass mortar  coated with mastic , & encased & into another wooden mortar , so that it does not break, this can be useful to perfumers , & la t  use a glass pestle  too.

Glass mortar  and table  for crushing.

Vitrified saltpeter 

Melted with pebbles , it makes the glass  very white. But rather, it needs to be calcined on a hot tile or paddle . And mix the liquid remains of the vapor with as much white, calcined pebbles . It is true that, in the little oven , it does not make it very clear. But for big windows, it makes the glass  very clear, & white & clean.

Windows through which the sun will not pass
Take the aforementioned calcined saltpeter  & expose it to a humid air or place, and it will convert itself into a liquid which, if rubbed on both sides of the windows, the sun will not pass through; rather, it will cast shade. One needs to put the saltpeter  on any clean place, & put glowing coals  on it, and continue all over until it no longer burns.

It also serves for melting &for adding in with alkali salt  for cleaning hands .

Gemstones 
Take white pebbles  that are found along rivers & along gravel banks, & paths and that are somewhat transparent. If they are perfectly transparent, & it will be better. If not, use the best & whitest ones that you can find. Calcine them three or 4 times in your four à vent   &  quench them in water  or vinegar . Then, take a ℥   of them and pound them in a completely pure copper  mortar , & with a pestle of pure copper  , and grind them until they become very fine & soft powder; this is a sign that they have taken enough of the substance ofcopper  to give them greenness. Then in your ℥   of pebbles , add in three ℥   of good minium , unadulterated by brick  & something else, and strongly pound everything together again in a bronze  mortar . And in all of this, add in a gros  pour ℥     of sel de verre  , & some & the common people put in sandever  that they find it among the glassmakers  or apothecaries . But alkali salt , as you know, is better.


Emerald  


In this way, the vulgaire  makes emeralds  & casts them in sand. If you do not have a bronze  mortar , crush avecq un mort  in a cauldron of pure copper  .

The crucibles need to be reheated before putting materials in, and need to be put in the forge [a] or four à vent   instead of making & increasing the fire.

For ruby  take gold in leaves
Raise your stove  by two tiles  all around because more heat is needed to make rubies  than emeralds . And take an ℥   of white, calcined pebbles , and put it in a glass  mortar  &, having roughly pounded it with the same kind of pestle , mix un grain   in the weight of a grain  of gold  leaves of the kind used by painters  for gilding, & crush.

 again quite hard, and then add to it three ℥   of minium , & pound again together & put it in the crucible , which you will cover with an appropriate tile , not too thick, so that heat reverberates better. Then put it on the grill  of your furnace , having put a few thick, rounded tiles  under it. Next, fill your charcoal  furnace  to the mouth  with charcoal , heaped to the top, and let it light, and always maintain the heat even, without letting the charcoal  go down. And to this effect, always ensure that the furnace  is heaped to the top & full of charcoal  and maintain it like this for one day . The first experiment I made, only a yellow mass emerged, like minium  alone when vitrified, & with gold  grains, in a mass at the bottom. Try cemented gold  together with antimony .
 
If you need more heat, put tiles  on the edge of the mouth  of the glowing furnace , lean them one against the other to make the heat reverberate.
 
Topaz 
The same dose can be observed for all gemstones , which is one part  the weight of calcined pebbles  with three parts the weight of minium , pounding all separately in a copper  mortar  for emeralds , & in an iron  mortar  to make topazes  or amber  color, with pestles  similar to the mortars . Emerald  & topaz  are of the same heat, & for an hour  & a half, otherwise they could burn. Ruby  wants more time & more fire, & colored with gold  leaf. I believe that pumice stone  or fire-stone  for the ruby  would be better. See enamels . Also try to mix pieces of colored glass  or enamels  instead of pebbles . If the mass is not colored enough, pound it further in the iron  mortar .

Slightly burnt tartar  mixed in makes beautiful yellow, but not much is needed. Arene   also makes it more yellow.

Salt  for melting
Mix saltpeter  & common salt  and melt them together & cast on melted copper  or ch   in a bain , & it purifies & makes it run marvellously. First, one ought to decrepitate the common salt , that is to say holding it over a good fire until it no longer crackles or, to melt it better, in an four à vent  . And throw it neatly on marble  , then crush it & grind it very finely, then put it in a crucible  on as much saltpeter  & let it boil, & mix them together until

A very beautiful yellow came to me, without any grain more yellow than the others. It is true that it was strongly charged with colour. I believe it would be better to pulverize the pumice  in a glass mortar, because it & the minium  make enough yellow by themselves. A mass came to me, the top of which was the beautiful yellow, as mentioned, and the bottom was like a fire-stone  without transparency. With which, in mixing other

Tin  comes out better being thin & fine, rather than thick, because being thick & in great heat, it retracts.

Having said the first 9 pater nosters, pour out the first water  and put in new one, and wash and stir the composition for the time it takes you to say 8 pater nosters, and the 3rd time for as long as 7, and thus successively you will add new water , doing the same as above, until the last and single pater noster of nine.Then you shall have a soft white ointment, with which you shall besmear the burn for 9 days. But do not apply it any longer, since it would cause an overgrowth of flesh. You shall dress your burn twice a day, and each time you shall wash your face with water and wine mixed together, a little tepid, not rubbing but so to say pressing with wet linen , and you shall wipe it similarly with fine linen . And then apply the ointment, over which you can put ivy leaves . This causes hair to regrow and leaves no scar. I was taught this by a powder maker  who had almost completely burnt himself but showed no sign of the burn.

Gardening
To graft, it is necessary to take the new growth that was produced within the year by the tree you wish to graft.  And cut off a branch in which you can see that beside the place where the leaves join the stem, there are little buttons we call buds, the initial stages of a sprout.  With dexterity you must, with a very sharp pen-knife, cut in the shape of a graft a small bit of the skin of the tree , which contains a bud or a sprout with the leaf, as you can see in B.   Then on the tender wood, which is full of sap, and on which you wish to graft, cut quickly two lines as you can see  , then add in the middle a slit thusly 
 
.  Then with the point of your pen-knife separate the bark from the tree , and open it from the slit in the middle, and having neatly lodged your graft so that nothing is sticking out, only the sprout, binding everything well and wrap the whole thing with a bit of linen  or soft string.  In this way, there will be nothing uncovered but the leaf, which in three or 4 days will indicate whether the graft has taken hold, by being green.  Keep your graft in this way for seven or eight days.  Then unwrap it, and join it to the bark, keeping the sprout itself straight, and then rewrap the whole thing gently, but not as strongly as before.  And if there is any growth, leave it some room to grow and then three or four times

 Then, when the graft has taken hold, cut the top of the tree, which is above your tree, three or four fingers above the graft for the first time.  Then, closer so that it serves. But be advised that when you do your initial grafting there should be no small hole at the back of your sprout, because this means that root is broken and your graft will never take.  Therefore make sure the back is in tact.  This type of grafting can be done from mid-May onwards, because the trees have budded and made new growth, until the beginning of August when the trees are full of sap.  Almond trees which are naturally drier lose their sap earlier.  Those who want to graft onto them the almond trees  mericotons, apricots and nut-tree grafts, which are the best, should do so usually in January.  Nut trees, such as perches mericotons should be grafted en fente.  It is said that trees graft by the shield-graft method take longer to bear fruit.

In order to catch them, you must observe them in real life, the food that they favor and their mating season.  The nightingale , as long as he is singing, marks his own territory.  Therefore approach him by pretending to look for something on the ground.  Take some worms  from old flour or from beneath what you are kneading or from mills, which nightingales  love, and put some on your hat, fastened with a pin or in any other way, so that it can wiggle.  And five or six steps away from the hedge where it is singing, dig a hole, and place some worms  in it, as well as your device made out of little criss-crossed sticks.  As soon as you leave it will be anxious to go and see what you have done.  And seeing worms  it will enter.
Some people sell nightingales  on trees.
It is easier to catch nightingales  in the cool of the morning or evening, near fountains or shaded areas.

Nightingale 
The iron  wire used for its cage must be the thickest possible, so that should it try to leave, it will not hurt itself.  At the beginning of its captivity cover its cage in fabric. The first day you will have to forcibly feed it, moving it from its cage in your hand and opening its beak and with a small wooden needle, place its food  in its throat and make it swallow. And continue to do so until it is no longer willful.  You must do this to keep it alive, because should it become thin or lose weight it will die.

Nightingale 
It will need a cage made in the shape of a barn, like the ones for larks , lined with green fabric, because it feels the cold. And to get it to eat when it is first put in the cage, you must give it ants  mixed with earth  in the bottom of the cage to get it used to pecking, and you can give it minced sheep 's heart, and sometimes eggs, and sometimes mealworm .

For casting
Asphaltum is , which is found in Germany  , is the most excellent sand one can find for molding in a frame , because it is appropriate for silver  & for gold , & the more you use it and the older it is, the better it is. One molds in it very thinly & finely.

Making gold  run  for casting
Because gold  cools down very quickly, one ought to give it a mix whenmelted q   it is well melted which maintains the heat. Sublimate  softens it nicely. But, because it goes up in smoke, it does not continue to help. Therefore mix this composition when you want to cast:  sal ammoniac , the best verdet   that you can find, a little borax  & saltpeter qui li   . And this, by keeping it heat, it will come out neatly. Saltpeter  clarifies it & p   heats it. But the most important thing in this mixture is the verdet  , which has to be good. This mixture softens the gold qui   so much that it becomes treatable like lead , even fine gold . 
For sand for molding flowers & leaves & delicate things, mix in well-ground raw plaster , brick  & alum de plume  .
To moisten sands, eau de vye   is excellent, for it grinds the sand  finely & evaporates que   when one reheats the frames .
Sal ammoniac water  is very good, is excellent for moistening sands , but for lots of water  one only needs a little sal ammoniac .
A lump of iron , for lack of crocum ferri  , is exce   good for gold .
The snakes  or lizards  you want to mold should not be kept for a long time, for if they are alive, they get thin, and if they are dry il   dead, they wither.
Plaster of Paris   is as firm as stone  & very good. When you will want to choose some for your sand, take it raw, the hardest possible & which does not make any powder. The transparent one and the one that thusly makes powder retract, ce   which is not good for this work.  A sign of the one that is close to perfection is that it is hard & made of lustrous grains nearing the shape of sugar . Finally, to mix some into the sand to cast gold , it is necessary that it endures the fire twice, & is reheated twice.
+  When gold  is very fine, it is so dry that it can hardly endure a hammer , but this mixture softens it like lead .

Casting in gold 
To cast in gold , crocum ferri  is necessary, & more stone alum  than in the following mixture. The stone alum  mixture cannot spoil anything. The mold must be red & close it immediately with iron  presses.
Shells of crabs & shells of  crayfish are troublesome to burn & have their own proper way of being molded.
When molding rats & birds, the feet, being burned, are difficult to recover, because they are small & slender. The body is recovered more easily from the mold. The feet are cast in many pieces.

Tiles 

those of houses that are outdoors, ones that are  a bit sand y seem to hold better in fire
Tiles  with which one covers houses, the hardest & surest and recleaned of stones  & large gravel , are taken to mix in with the sand  for molding. But, rather, it is necessary to reheat them just until they have been quite red for one or two hours, & crush them & pass them finely through a sieve.
Little turtles just out of the egg are really delightful to mold.

---------
If the plaster  is mixed with some dust  or is not the hard kind, ...  in the fire & make ...  
The hardest plaster , as was said, is the best, being taken thusly totally raw from stones of this kind. Crush it as finely as possible and pass it through the most fine sieve or sleeve that you can. Having been made fine in this way, put a good amount in a cauldron or frying pan over an open flame. & as it starts to heat up, stir it continuously. And heavy and lumpy though it is, it will become so light and so tractable that it will appear to you not to have any resistance to the said stirring, as though it were of water. Continue to keep stirring it continuously until it returns once again to being heavy and thick. And now this is the sign that it is cooked, but do not reheat it at all such that your stone alum  brick be reheated & that clay  circles form. Because this must be the last reheating, and when everything else is ready, because the less that the plaster  remains reheated & the more suddenly it is put into the work, the better, because it takes rather better. It is not permitted to reheat it except when you want to mold. And to reheat it, put it, in fine, totally raw powder, in a cauldron on a clear flame & do not give it too much heat  in one go nor too fierce. Stir continuously with a long stick, turning around the cauldron to avoid the vapor. & in the middle, in the form of a figure 8 at the beginning, you will find it heavy and  clayey because it is full of moisture, and  when it heats up, it will start to throw off the moisture  in some bubbles on the edges of the cauldron. And finally it will become liquid & mealy & like bran & start boiling in the middle. Continue to stir continuously until you recognize that it has once again become heavy ʘʘ
Stone alum  is that which binds well to sand .
Crocum ferri  is fit for gold . It is this which, mixed into sand , breaks it up again & keeps it hot.

---------
Plaster 
When you have it in stone form, choose the hardest pieces and those which do not easily break into small pieces with your nail, and clean it well of powder & filth rather than crushing them with it.
Plaster  alone does not sustain ...  but breaks up into lumps.


Keep reheated plaster , as is said here, one or two months well compacted in a dry place, if it's not the rainy season but rather fresh out it is more excellent for exquisite work.


It must maintain its fire & turn red like lit charcoal.

 107r
  
 as heavy as before, and it should be like a paste not very thick, &it must not be as easy to stir & as a liquid. This state shows you that it is cooked enough. It must boil in the middle, & all around you must have a thick mixture. If you reheat it too much your mixture would be short of body, because if it becomes red the mixture will lose its strength & it will spoil the sand . Let it cool before mixing it to any other sand . … 

Catching lizards   and snakes  
Take a stick and attach a string at the end, with has an knot eyelet eyelet  that slips at the end. And, being two to three, to distract the lizard while whistling, approach him with the noose of the eyelet, and when he has his head inside, pull. The lizard is more tedious to catch by hand than the serpent & bites without letting go & grips like pincers.
Snakes can be caught by hand, provided that it is covered by a thick woollen cloth, for the teeth of the snake stay in the cloth, & and cannot pierce like they would with a linen. The dangerous ones are recognisable by their blue eyes & asses  deep azur. They hardly ever bite in water, which crayfish catchers have experienced.
The sand  mixture is of two thirds of plaster , pulverized & reheated as it is said, & one part of tile ,  reddened et p pre in a good fire , after the first cooking & then finely pulverized, and of alum de plume  , half of brick, namely two full crucibles of plaster, one of brick & a half of alum de plume . There can never be too much alum de plume ,s  for this is what gives bond to the sand, and because it does not burn, it makes sand withstand the fire without cracking and bursting.  Otherwise, without it, the sand would not withstand. This sand, thus composed, is appropriate for all metals, but if you want to use it for gold, it needs more alum de plume & ,than the above mentioned composition, and mix in some crocum ferri, and for it is this one that attracts gold.
It is necessary that all sand  with which you want to cast, withstands the fire well, that is to say that it withstands abon c  a great firing without getting spoiled.
Alum de plume  is troublesome to crush, and it does not pass through the sieve. Thusly one ought to grind it finely on marble . And the one, white que v  in powder form, that apothecaries  sell, is good. It is finely ground better su  in the mortar by crushing &dragging the pinon , thus you will render it very fine.
Crocum ferri  must be set ablaze in a glassworker ’s furnace for four days.

 107v
 Molds for fine things, like wormwood  or something similar, can only be used once, dip the molds into water  before breaking them. Things twice reheated are dissolve easily into water . If you don't do that your work will be hard to be stripped of the mold without being spoiled.
Good stone alum  is white and as shiny as white silk, this stone alum  is made of long pieces, as long as a finger, & is very fragile & woolly and fluffy. Stone alum  made of stone  is harder & not so good. The best quality can be found in France near Ronan. For our sand , stone alum  must be crushed into a mortar, and must be ground on the marble  again. Don't even think about sieving it because this matter is fat & woolly, it wouldn't pass through any sieve because of the very fine & soft filaments. These filaments give the sand  a much greater binding effect than natural wool  or even the filler  the foundry owner  uses for big works, because natural wool  & filler  burn and stone feather alum  resists fire.
When you cast surround the sand  of your mold with very beaten greasy earth . Make a circle & around your mold with this earth .
Archanum omnibus fere reconditum est in re fusoria,

videlicet  res exprimenda formis, sive herba  sit sive animal 

ut lucerta , inmergatur primum in vini spiritum 

aprime rectificatum, deinde pulvere composito aspergatur

sive illinatur (si pulvis in formam pultis redactus sit, ut

When you want to mold something hollow, the core must be made of the same matter, if the snake or the animal is curved or folded you must do your core in several pieces.
Try to see  if distilled vinegar  is good for eating away, & it will dissolve the animal  inside the hollow mold.

If you know that your plaster  cannot endure fire without breaking, do not take the recipe of the mixture literally, sometimes you can add less stone alum  than above. Because stone alum  soften molds. Once reheated do not grind the stone alum  again, leave it ground as the apothecaries  did. It will not prevent the cast from being neat, & will give more binder to your cast. When the mold holds the color of the brick and is reddened then it will be harder.

 108r
 To hold the cores, some people  use wire  made of the same metal  as that to be cast because it boils down & is made similarly, but when it is melted or pliant the core varies. Other people  find it serves them better to use sharpened iron wire  about the borders because it holds more firmly, & having fine points it does not rise up any more than the point of a needle and one can apply gold  or silver  on this rather than putting it in works where  one makes a hole in the work with a small chisel.
Spirits  prevent the sand from bubbling & do not make little holes on the borders of the mold if the thing to be molded is very damp, the holes & farts & bubbling does not make it in the place of the mold which is thick but at the borders which are more delicate.
One casts ordinary silver  of the sort goldsmiths  coarsely work, which is made with mediocre alloys . And when one casts with solder , it runs even better.
Spalt  is a whitish stone which can be found in Germany, & mainly in Augsburg from which can be made the most excellent sand  that can be found for casting lead , tin , copper , silver  & gold . And the more it is used, the better it is. It is clean for casting flat things in a frame. For rounded things, it is not as attractive because it  does not hold in the fire as the aforementioned things  composed of plaster .
The snippings of a  large piece of  greasy leather  are good to cast in melted copper  and brass  because they clean it & take away from it all its filth . 

Spalt 
Spalt  is white like cooked plaster  and one can find it in mounds and stones made in long stairs & long veins. It is very soft such that with a fingernail & it makes a powder like that of our chalk  from Champagne. And because everything which is provided from the earth  is mixed with some other substance, to purify it the spalt , one boils it with somewhat large gemstones  then tempers it with essence of sal ammoniac . One puts a lump of it  the size of a walnut in a large bottle of water  and

 108v
 that way one tempers it & reducing it into small balls, one  purges it of impurities by  then putting it on to cook cleanly in a vessel of earthenware  in a furnace like those in which pots are made  and one leaves it there to the point at which pots would be fired. After one tempers it more with essence of sal ammoniac  & boiling it very strongly and emptying the murky water  & putting it in a separate vessel straight after put back the same water  over it & one boils & one puts back the murky water  again with the other. And one does this therefore  until that which is there has passed away. In this way one purges & purifies & makes it a very fine & malleable matter . After one has taken away the water  by tilting it  or with a sponge , one takes the residue and dries it. Then moistening it with the aforementioned water  the way one did with the other sand , one uses it in a frame or if it shrinks this  is a sign that it is not fired enough & needs to be fired more. This one is proper for molding all metal  and especially gold  & silver  and the more it is used the better it is. One should put alum  which you have cast of lead  or tin  separately because it makes gold  sour if you cast it there.

Stone alum  
Stone alum  must be reheated in a pot covered with a tile  over a good charcoal  fire so that the impurities which might be in it are  burned with that which does not burn. This is done either in the goldsmith  forge surrounded by bricks or in a little oven vented to the fusion fire such that the pot stays red for a quarter of an hour. This is more to purify it than for anything else. It becomes reddish on top & the inside remains white & dries best this way.# 
#  Once your stone alum  is cooled down, crush it in a mortar, then grind it more finely on marble . And this makes it into very fine wooly dust that gives binding to sand  without burning like all other things. This is  a beautiful invention. Crush it on the mortar to being careful to keep the grindings together because the dust flying can get down your collar or on your face which can have very grave consequences. Put a little each time in the mortar to avoid the dust flying. It is best to grind therefore with the pestle trained on the mortar rather than on the marble  where it spreads & on the mortar it gathers the dust  from all sides and renders it very fine & sweet to the touch.

Clay  
Clay  used to surround molds, should be very fat & malleable, and should not be used for anything else except to make the contour of the molds. Therefore one should only chose that which is very fat and beat it very well & soak it moderately with water  & have it in a pit or earthenware  pot and make good holes with a stick with which one replenishes it with water  to keep it always fresh & soft and ready to use when needed.

 109r
Modelling with wax 
When wax  is too hard, one mixes in turpentine  or a little butter , which sont pl  renders the wax  more amiable, and more appropriate than thetallow  that the Italians  put in, because one has to, often, put the tools in the mouth, which are better in box wood  or bone of hart .

Wax  for molding
Since the wax  is molten, they have some sulphur  in a spoon or crucible & pour it in the molten wax . And with the sulphur  going to the bottom or staying on top, it stays where it is & mixes only its substance in the wax , & renders it more meltable when warming it, in such a way that having molded it, the wax   gently melts in the mold like butter , without leaving any blister or boil.  Also be warned to not give it too much heat.
If

Molding wax 
So that your mold takes hold without repelling any surface on a form or figure in wax ,  it is necessary to rub the wax  with oil  and soak your sand in lukewarm water , because cold water  repels oil  even more & will not make a good layer on the wax .
Rub the oil  on very very lightly, use  so little that it hardly appears at all. Then rub with some spirits . After soak your sand in lukewarm water  so that it does not repel the oil .

Forge bellows
It is better that at the end with the air chamber the bellows be set in some kind of bit of cloven board because they are more secure this way. Afterwards you can lightly secure them from the top.  It is necessary that the nozzles be four fingers above the bottom of the forge.

Molding snakes 
When you get them for molding, if it is possible, do not remove their teeth if you think you might  want to keep them, because having had their teeth removed, it hurts their gums & mouths, & they can no longer eat.  You can keep the snakes  in a barrel full of bran  or even better of earth , in a cool place, or in a glass  bottle.  And give them some live frog or other live animal because they do not eat anything that is  dead. Also I have noticed that
 
 109v
 when they want to bite or to eat something, they snakes  do not go at it head on, but sideways & by sinuous coiling, as do Satan & his henchmen. The snake has a small head, but a very large body; the entryway to sin seems small & inconsequential, but the consequences are great indeed. A snake can abstain from eating for seven or eight days, once he has swallowed a frog, and can swallow three or four frogs, one after the other, and what it has devoured does not rot & is not digested all at once in its stomach, but each part little by little, i.e. the bones and everything. The rest is just as fresh as when the snake ate it, such that when one bothers & torments it, it spits out what it swallowed up, which, in part, is totally digested, & with the other part as fresh as if the frog were alive. It can hold a swallowed frog down for two or three hours & spit it out alive.

Toad
If by chance you want to mold this ugly animal & if it should piss in your hand, it will sting your hand & cause it to itch, as if you had been holding nettles. But the very best remedy for this is to put your hand into fresh dirt , & to cover it as if you wanted to bury it. Frogs are not so beautiful when molded because they have shiny skin, & toads have lumpy skin.

You can mold the toad hollow, and leaving a notch open on the underbelly, you will make it jump with the twisted cord of the saw. If it is a small, put it on a magnet  cut small to the size of the toad, then put it in good vinegar .

If it is big, mold hollow, & if you want to mold it with its mouth open, put some cotton  therein, & then put some melted wax  on the cotton .

Killing snakes for molding
Some put a drop of aqua fortis  into their mouths, which stupefies them, so that the head & the body look dead. But the head is still alive, and when you stick it with a needle in order to fix it to your mold, it moves & spoils & undoes everything. Therefore, to kill your snake, put it into a bottle filled with good vinegar  & some spirits . Do the same with lizards & other similar animals.

If you want to keep them, you can put them in a pipe full of dirt  in a garden outdoors, but it is necessary that the pipe be covered with latten wire , because otherwise, the snakes will crawl & climb up quite high.

 110r
Casting
You could cast from already casted things and animals, but it never works as well as from the natural original  ones, with which you can make four or five molds.

Rock & grotto
You need to grind white & yellow marcasites  & various kinds of mines . & wash them thoroughly, so the soiled & chalky end will be clean, & in order that only the lustrous grain of the mine  will be left, from which you will powder your rock previously covered with colle forte , if your grotto is not used as a fountain & touches water. You will thus obtain a nice work.

Snakes
When they feel trapped, they seldom bite, & cannot really hurt unless they are really big snakes. The most important thing is to avoid being bitten before capturing them. Having put your foot as close as possible from the neck, you holds it as close to the head as possible. That way, it will not bite if it cannot stretch its neck & do a sinuous turn, it will not be able to hurt from a frontal attack, nor will it be able to twist into an S. I have found out that the person who taught me how to mold them was little afraid of snakes. & he would catch one and pull it quickly, & grabbed it by the neck &, putting it under his shoe, flattened it so it would eject from the behind, which is five or six fingers from the tail, everything that is bad and venomous in the belly. After that, the snake has no strength to bite and, if by chance it still bites and ejects from its behind some garbage, he the man  would dig in the soil with a knife & bury his hand in the fresh & humid soil which, applied to the infected part of the hand, would  suck all the venom, without doing anything else. It was the same with toad venom, as I have seen experimented.

In three days  it is as thin as if he had not eaten. Cast it right after catching it is the best, before it loses weight. You should kill it only a quarter of an hour before you want to cast it.
 
 110v
When a snake   has eaten something; when tormenting it, it will vomit the food . And if, after having eaten something, the snake  is pressed underfoot, this troubles the snake  a lot & makes it sick. If the snake  is wounded, it will not eat voluntarily.

Molds 
There is nothing better for opening them up than to oil them with olive oil , & nothing else. And afterwards, when you want to separate them, soak them in cold water ; that is the secret. And you will see that the oil ,  although it seems to be imbued, will separate itself from the water  as does  grease. Mussels  become stronger in cold water , and warm water  would dissolve them with difficulty, although having been reheated, the mussels  are then  more handleable & easy to dissolve in the water .

Wheat oil 
Is made on a blade of iron  reddened in the fire, and the oil  turns into drops, which is appropriate to oil the hair of a butterfly or similar thing, because this oil  is instantly dry & makes the rest dry out.  It is necessary that the coat or down of any animal that you want to mold be flat, because if left  standing up, it will make the sand raise up & form bubbles.
#  If you want to mold something delicate, like a pansy, some, to give it a little thickness, more than what is natural, some rub it with butter .  But it is best to oil it with wheat oil  because it has no opacity & does not block the smaller features as much, and makes the flower firmer.

A cast of lead  or tin 
Because you want to cast tin  very thinly, if your medal, plant or other thing you want  to mold is thin & fine, make sure  to include more tin , much more than lead , namely less than the fourth part of lead  for three of tin . And moreover, one only puts lead  in as an alloy. Contrarily, if you want to mold something strong & thick, put a lot more lead  in than tin . And for the one & the other you can put in a little looking-glass tin , but only a very little, with a little resin , when you want to cast.  Since then, when molding with pure new lead , I put in two ounces of pure tin  for every pound of lead  .  And when molding with pure tin , I put in two ounces of pure lead  for every pound of tin  . I made some plants & snakes as if they were real.

I cast tin when it was  nearly red, and the same thing with lead , which however had not remained in the fire for too long, because it becomes brittle and burns up.

 111r
Reheating molds
Box molds dry out readily, & do not get reheated, because to reheat is properly to turn molds red & inflamed in the fire, and drying out is to let both molds dry, or make them evaporate their humidity, placing them before a fire of flames or one of charcoal. Molds de noyau reheat easily & box molds dry out.

Latten smoke 

It is good to reheat molds for casting latten  in it, because this yellow chalk , which appears nevertheless to refill the molds, casts very neatly, being of the same nature.

For red copper 
When it's melted, it is good to throw in a little fine tin , because this makes it run.

Clay earth 
This, wet & well beat & kneaded as you know, is necessary for you to make the contour of your molds. But attend that it not be too soft. But likewise attend that it be  sort of half dry such that it doesn't attack the hands at all, because otherwise it would attack your work. Always keep it in a damp place, and make some holes in it, and fill them with water, to keep it fresh.

The gray earth   is best which does not cleave at all.

It is neater than   of lead .
 
Iron  wire
You have to be provisioned with different thicknesses according to the molds that you want to make, some large like packthread from   & some thin, like the fat cords of a spinet, for small works. With it reheated, make clamps to close the molds & make points like needles of various lengths according to your need, to fasten the animal to the mold & hold it subject. Needles would not be good for this since your points must be hollow & of the same thickness throughout, except at the point. And then you have to make them as long as you have need. Iron  wire is harder than that of latten .

 111v
sal ammoniac water 
It is enough to use two chestnuts ' worth of sal ammoniac  pulverized in a pot of water , and that the water tastes lightly salted to your tongue, because too much is not good.

Sanguine 
To clean the various colors of lead  & tin , sanguine  is pulverized, & it is rubbed on the molded work with pieces of fabric.

Crab  and crayfish 

They are among the most difficult to mold, & whoever molds them well will mold many other very subtle things.

Lizards 
When one grabs them with two fingers from the sides of the head, at the level of the ears, one makes them open their mouth with the tip of the fingernail, & then one grabs the edge of their lower jaw, and then the edge  of the upper one. He squeezes the fingernail like a pair of pincers, but he cannot go through it, but he squeezes it quite hard; and if he bit the flesh, he would never let go of his hold, & there would be no better remedy than to cut off his head promptly. In the spring, as they have shed their skin, they are better-looking.

The small lizards  that one catches in the summer, the size of small female lizards , grey on the back & green on the belly, are very appropriate to cast in silver, & gold, or other metal, because their scales are rougher than those of female lizards   & show better.


Composition of sand 
Everything being baked thoroughly as said above, take four 4 molds full of plaster , two 2 of brick , & one of alum de plume . Do not pass through the sieve to mix, because the alum  would not go through. Mix it with your hands until neither one nor the other, neither white nor red, may be distinguished from the other. If your plaster  is not strong, do not mix in as much alum de plume  because it softens molds. Make sure too that your sand  is not hot (since it has been baked thoroughly recently) when you will want to mix it with water , because that makes molds too soft & breakable.


You may sometimes decrease the quantity of plaster  if you do not find it strong enough to resist fire & if it splits, &  so that the proportion of crushed tiles  sustains it, with the alum de plume , which you can also increase so that it creates a better bond.

 112r
To temper the sand 
You should have: a large basin full of water  to dip the molds into in order to open them, a tankard full of common water , a dish to temper the sand , a small wooden  spoon to pick up the mixed sand  in the dish.

To make handles for your large oil brushes, if you do not have large enough feather pipes , take two of them, & melt them & join them together.
 
Decoction of sands 
Already said

Molding en noyau. Mixing of sand 
Once you have reheated your sand , that is the plaster , the stone alum  & the brick , & once you have finely filtered them through a cloth  sieve, #  mix them the following way: take four measures of plaster , two measures of bricks , & one measure of stone alum . Mix them all together with the hands, so that one may not discern one ingredient  from the other. Once your sand  is ready, you need to kill the animal that you wish to mold in this way.
#  except for the stone alum  which should be ground in a mortar.

Killing the animal to mold
You must have been careful not to hurt it while capturing it. If you have a stock of animals  and you wish to keep them for a long time, place it in a glass  bottle with bran  or in a large barrel half full of damp & fresh earth . Give them frogs to eat, live & and not dead, because should you keep them without feeding them, they would wither & become emaciated, & their skin would become saggy and wrinkled. Therefore, the sooner after its capture you mold it, the better it will come out. And kill it in the following manner: place it in a clean bottle or vessel so that the animal  does not carry any dust ; fill the bottle  with enough good vinegar  & urine  so as to cover the animal . Shake the bottle  & torment the animal  inside there until it is dead which should take an hour or half an hour. But if you are in a hurry

To know if the animal  is quite dead, take it out of the vinegar  and take it by the tail. If it moves its tail, do not mold it because it still has feelings, & when pricking its members , it would remove itself & harm the mold.

Water snakes do not bite much.
 
 112v
 to cast, force feed it your animal  some good spirits  or mix a bit of spirits  with the vinegar . And soon it will be dead without any wounds that would deform it. As for large animals, for which it is necessary to have a lot of spirits , one uses vinegar  and urine . But for small ones, spirits  only are needed, and it will be done quicker.

When your animal is dead, take it out & clean it very carefully, relieving it  of its old skin if it sheds, of its parasites  like lizards  have, and then apply it.
in a glass, & submerge & continuously hold the head of the animal. Or if it is not very big, put the whole thing in.
Be advised that before it dies, you must open it eyes, by blocking its eyelids with a bit of wax  or something else.

Affixing and arranging animals
Having gotten in some fat earth  called clay , that should be grey, because that is the best one, or another that will bind well & will be well prepared & beaten, so that it is malleable without being damaging your hands or the work, make a lazagne, or a pancake shape, of this clay  equally flattened with a rolling pin, which pastry-makers  use so that it is slightly thicker than a poulc.  And on this pancake, affix your animal, making it as life-like as possible & the way in which it is naturally shaped. And firstly, with a good needle, pierce it from underneath, in the middle of the throat, & up to the top bone of the head. Then take the needle out & in its place & its hole, put the point of an iron  wire, of such a length that it suffices to maintain the head of the animal as high as it must be, & if the skin gets in &  when you put in the wire, take it out with the edge of your small pincer, & arrange the skin as it was before. Pierce the other end of the wire in the sheet of clay . In this way the head will be held high, which will make it more graceful & proud. Arrange afterwards, the rest of the body, & the legs, & the curling as you think will look best. And so that it is secure & does not move when you put in the sand, secure the legs & the body with little points of iron  wire, having already made the first hole with a very sharp needle. Do the same on the body parts that you deem necessary, making sure that the points going through the animal are fixed in the clay  sheet, and not so far in front that they jut out beyond the body of the animal by a
Take a needle of fine steel , & which will be the sharpest you can find,  so that with it, when you make your first hole in order to place the wire threads, it will pass through without effort, & take care not to rudely insert the wire or take skin with it.  Then put a thicker wire in the thick bits of the animal  & the thinner wire in the thinner bits. But take this secret advice and do not plant your pointed wire in one go through the animal and onto the plaster , but having planted it, take it out of the clay  earth & not out of the animal, & which is afterwards fastened there. One does this because by fastening the point the first time, it pushes in the skin of the serpent and by taking the point out, it replaces the skin in its original state.
When you reuse the points you have already used, make sure to clean them well of rust, so that they do not take away some skin.
The main arrangement of your casting is to keep its head very high & have it looking sideways.  For this effect, pierce the head on a solid plank or table &   , making the wire pass through the bottom of the throat up to the top of the head

 a bit so that you can take it out if you need to. And be advised that these needle points must be of the thinnest kind of iron  wire, with a length that is suitable to the animal; because the smaller your needle is, the smaller the leftover hole will be. However, you must have different sized ones because there are some needles that go on the body & in places that are thicker, like under the throat, and some needles  must be longer & stronger than the ones used on legs & thin places, where the needles must be subtle & thin, almost like the biggest harpsichord strings. And it would be better if they were of iron  wire, which is firmer than the one made of latten . And if piece of a tail, a piece of nail or a piece of leg to the body needs to be joined to the body, do not use the needle; it would damage these parts. But apply a bit of wax , as big as a grain of millet , between the body & the end of the tail. Then with a bit of iron  wire, flattened & warm, touch the wax  & join the two pieces by applying a bit of pressure. In this way, after your animal has been well-placed on the lute-shaped pancake of clay earth ,   
build around it a wall of the same clay   in this way. & join everything together. And then with a big knife, with which you have cut the clay , take away the extraneous clay  surrounding the pancake. & place on a piece at the end of the mold to close it off, as you see in B. Then, with a small curved instrument, mark on the inside of your mold the thickness you wish, which for a common serpent  must be two inches thick; so that when you put in your wet sand, you will see when it is thick enough. When all of this is neatly set out, moisten well the shaped body of the animal everywhere, with good spirits , with a brush.  For this is the best-kept secret: because everything that is touched by spirits  will come out very neatly & without any small eyes or holes that we call bubbles, which usually come not at the back & in the thick sides of the mold, but on the edges.  And as soon as you have thusly moistened everything with spirits , put in your wet sand without letting the spirits  evaporate, which they do quickly.  And soak it thusly.
  and make sure the needle is as long as you need according to how much you want to raise the head, and that both ends are sharp. Having been arranged thusly, affix your serpent  on the clay earth , & place the head first and then the rest.


If, once you have placed you animal on sheet of clay , you are distracted with other occupations, rub your animal with spirits  & under the belly so that it does not stick & attach itself to the clay  earth .
 
If, when you pierce the belly of your animal, it releases water  on the plaster , clean it well with cotton  because the sand that was wet will become lumpy. If it is on top of the animal, clean it very carefully and very neatly and touch it & strongly wet it with spirits .

Wetting sand and molding the first cast
Have a porringer of leaded earth  of such a size that it can hold the wet sand which will be needed to fill your mold in one go, which is better than in two gos, because if you do not throw the second load of sand in very quickly, there is a risk that while you are preparing it, the first one will take & become solid,
 
 113v
 and this way, while heating it again, the two casts will dissolve. Therefore, have several dishes of various sizes with a pouring beak in order to cast better. In these, pour some regular fountain water  & mix into it as much as an egg #  can hold of sal ammoniac water , mixed as described. If you want to cast lead  or tin  - because one would need more for casting gold  & silver  - having the water  in your dish, add the sand  & not the other way around by adding the water to the sand , & adjust it with such attentiveness that, while mixing it vigorously & wetting it quickly with a wood en  spoon, it does not become thicker than mustard.  And in such a way cast i.e., pour  first the clearest part, as is always at the surface, by shaking it & a little higher in your mold.  And doing so, since your animal is nearly covered, Once your animal is covered, blow on it very strongly to eliminate the small bubbles from your soaked sand . & then pour immediately the rest which is at the bottom & which is thicker than the upper part, fill your mold to the thickness mark you have made.   And while casting do not forget to shake your mold, that way your soaked sand runs & get in through every parts. Also tip your mold up on the side of the head, which is higher than the body. That way the contents of your mold will have the same thickness, & you'll spare sand . This being done with care, your sand  will harden within a quarter of an hour. Then peel the clay  contour which can be used later. Let it dry a little bit, & separate your mold from the slab of earth, and you can mold properly straight after. Cut away the extra parts with a knife, and make it mandore shaped. You can reuse the clay  frame. Scrape & cut away what's on the back of the mold, because this part is the weakest; do not forget to make notches around it, that way the second cast would bind much better 
  and would not move.

Your half mold, in one shot & one mix is the best.
# 
or two eggs , because there is no danger if there is more. If you cast twice, just add sal ammoniac water  into the first pouring.

Make your mixture as clear as a pureed broth, or starch water , the one women use make their starch . It is not a problem if the mixture is very thin because sand settles in the bottom & water  stays on top of it, which we scape as too weak & soft. It will not take long to harden, because burned things dry rapidly.
 
If you don't fill your mold with soaked sand  at one go, do mix your second cast with the top part of the first cast, stir with a spoon, or the stick you had took to soak your sand.
You do not need to add sal ammoniac water  if you cast small molds which do not need to be reheated too long. However it is better to add some.

Second Casting
When you have well molded the first part of the animal, that is to say the back, the spine, and the entire top part, and when the half-mold where the part is encased is hard enough   turn over the bottom & the sides of the belly, sometimes using a knife & tanto  for the thicker parts, & then with a pen-knife for the places where the more fragile parts are encased, like legs, tail, & similar things. Because the head is higher, you will have to dig deeper to expose it & do a deeper notch that has to be well exposed, by enlarging it from the outside, in order for the second mold that you cast on top of it releases well. A process for which the animal himself can be useful because his nature so permits. However, make sure that you reveal the lizard 's throat more than you would do a snake , because the lizard  has big jaws & big bones that do not cast as easily, and has deep ears in which the wet sand is not as easy to remove. But you will avoid all of this if you expose half of the head and those things that you know do not release easily. When everything is well exposed, blow over it & wipe each part again with a cloth made of swine  hair, slightly dampened into salt water  or clear water , do that gently, that way the lower part of your uncovered animal will be very neat. # 🝋  Once it is done, dip the covered side of your mold into water  for a pater noster. It will suck water inside, that way when you'll rub with oil  the uncovered side, the oil  will remain on the top, & to prevent the second cast which you will cast on top from sticking. Dip your mold into water , take a particularly fine brush & rub with oil  the entire mold but the animal; it should not be touched with oil . & Make sure to use you brush between the parts & on all the fragile parts. And if by mistake oil  is soaked, dip the mold into water , as it is said above, & drop by drop the oil  will come back to the top.

Mold small animals as big ones, however, for small animals, use very fine tacks made of cords of cittern, short & long ones.
 
remove all the little tacks with the help of very small flat pincers.
# 
then
+   
# However, leave the tack which is pinned into the throat so that it will help you to turn the head over, because it is sunk deeper than any other part, because when you drew the plan, you put higher up. It is at the level of the head that you must make the biggest notch & you should start at that notch to expose and then keep following by looking at the traces left by the tacks. 
#  and if a small piece of nail, or piece of tail, or other fine things separate from the mold, put a little piece of wax between them, & join them with the tip of a hot iron  wire, then smooth it in your mold with a knife, & make notches on the sides in order for the other half of the mold to adhere to it. 🝋  
 
 114v
  This thus prepared, put your first half-mold on the disc of clay , & surround it with a clay  circle & do a thickness mark similar to the first one. Then, with a rather thick brush, wet with spirits  all your animal's exposed half, without, if possible, missing any part, because therein lies the secret to casting neatly. Then, as fast as possible before the spirits  evaporate, soak your sand, and cast it, shaking, blowing, & moving the mold, as you did for the first one, making sure that what you pour first on the animal is clearer than the rest, so that it is soaked everywhere & highlights the finer parts. So, leave it for fifteen minutes so it sets, then remove the clay  circle & disc. And, with a knife, join you two molds together in a longish form, like a mandore, as we say, because of how you cast. Then soak a little in water  the whole mold up to the level of the joints. Because this is another secret to separate them more easily . Otherwise, you would break everything. Separate them like this skillfully. After this, gently & patiently remove half of the animal still in the mold, pulling it sometimes on one side & sometimes on the other, in order to avoid breaking it, or ruining parts of the mold. The mold, being empty, rejoin both half so that no dust comes in, & put them aside until you want to heat them up, make the runners, & the vents & put the clamps. As for the animal, to avoid it drying, & in order to be be able to use it to mold 4 or 5 of times, put it on water . I believe that it would be better preserved in spirits . However, it would be best to make the 4 or 5 molds the same day because these animals rot and 
will smell within the day. Having left your molds to dry out, for they will stay humid for at least a month, make the vents for one half.  
+  Note that once you have made your second casting, if you left your mold without opening it for a day or a night, you would then need to put it into hot water  or reheat it, rather than open it, like for the crab .

If after both halfs of the noyau have set & hardened, it would not open if you did not dip it into water . But as you dip the back of your mold into water , oil  comes back to the top & touches the joints & separates them.

However, be sure that your second mold is thick enough, & hard enough otherwise it could break while dipping it into water  & if you want to open it. To avoid this mistake dip the entire mold into water  rub it everywhere, if the mold has set enough it will harden. Then take both molds with a rough cloth, in order to grip it better. Then strongly separate the molds as if you wanted to tear bread  apart. But in case it breaks, rejoin them, & fortifies the joints with clamps.
 

Afterwards you can repair the mistakes with a small pair of scissors.

First cast the tail or the back of your animal, make a cut from the head to the middle to the tail where you cast, and which is the end of the mandore. After casting do not forget to make holes, and to notch your casted metal . That way metal  will run better than if do not notch it.  Indeed metal  get damaged into notches, do not run too much and does not swell as much as if you do not make any notch. Put small clamps made of wire  to the joints separating both molds it will reinforce the joints of your mold. Clamps prevent molds from distorting and from getting damaged while heating.

 Note about everything above said
If your snake hasn't eaten for a long time, when you want to kill it into urine  and vinegar , it would fill with water  and would swell, and then it would dry when you fix it on clay .
Once casted, and removed out of the mold, you could see a small empty line between the animal and the mold where sand  will come in when you make the second cast. Try to avoid that if you can, but do not give up  your second casting because not much sand  comes in this empty space and it will be easy to clear it with the help of a small needle, also this sand  does not stick to the first cast.
Casts which must be reheated, like casts for gold  or silver , or other matters which must be burnt inside the mold, need more stone alum  than casts which are stripped of the mold easily, like lead  and tin . However do not add too much stone alum .

Stripping animal
If you'd made such a twist to your snake that you can not stripped its belly easily of the mold, and if the head and the mouth are thinner, and easier to be removed, do cut away the extra parts  of the mold, and do reheat the mold again. The matter inside will burn, then add some quicksilver  inside which will attract ashes  and burnt bones , the pipe will get wider, and your animal will get easily out of the mold without being damaged. You can strongly pull your molded snake, because it is soft and malleable, and your mold firm enough to keep its print undamaged.

Reheating molds
When  your molds are reheated, and cleaned, cast as soon as possible, because if you keep your molds it will corrode and become damp. Reheat the thickest part, where  the body of the animal is, on high position because if there is something to be burnt inside it will fall down. Mark the high part in order to recognize it.
Once well reheated, do not damp the outside of your mold too much because the inside must stay red when you cast.

It is the shape of the clamp

Tin  casting
If the herbage  or flower  you want to cast is delicate and fine, tin  must exceed lead  in your mixture; on the contrary, if it the flower or herbage is thick,  you must add into your mixture more lead  than tin . For a fine thing,  add one part of tin  for four parts of lead . Your mold must not be too hot, so you can hold it with your hand when you cast. Your alloyed tin  must be very hot and almost red for casting, and that way it will enter all the small parts of the mold. Otherwise, your tin will cool down before reaching the thin parts of your herbage . Do not forget to mix a little bismuth  in your mixture; that way, your tin will run better and be firmer.

With your lead  allied with tin , or tin  allied with lead , you can add a very little quantity of bismuth  and it will look silvery. But do not put too much, because if hardens the matter and makes it sour, and if your work on fine things -- like legs and similar things -- it will not cast properly.

Giving ventilation to your mold
If your herbage is very fine, in addition to vents, you can drive a thread through the clay  contour of your herbage instead of casting with a needle, and thread it also in the herbage. The thread will burn, like the herbage, and the hole will remain, thus giving extra ventilation.

Do not remove your annealed molds out of the fire  before they have cooled down by themselves. Also make sure that your very hot molds do not come into contact with wind or coldness otherwise they would burst. Do not reheat your molds before they are drained and firm again, otherwise they would cast before the vent holes are made and the clamps are fixed.

Annealing core molds
After your molds have their cast vents and clamps, fix the clamps as above mentioned. Then make a round, made of bricks , at the edge of your forge, or in a clean place. Fill this round with big, half-lighted pieces of charcoal . Put your molds on the round, and leave it during half an hour, that way it will gently heat up and not  all at once. Finally, when coals  start being white, add big half-lighted big pieces of charcoal  and blow with your small bellows until hot. Do as such, slowly, until the molds redden inside and out. If you want to cast a herbage or an animal which are difficult to strip, and you need to burn what is in the mold, look into the cast and see if it is molds are quite red and inflamed inside; this will be a sign that they are properly annealed. If it is not so, increase the heat and keep at it until it becomes thus. If there is nothing inside the mold to be burnt, this heat is good for tin  casting. The molds for tin  casting are much better annealed in a reverberatory furnace.

Do not heat too much at first otherwise your molds could break

You know that your molds are annealed enough if the hole in the cast is red, on the contrary if the hole is black  the molds are not annealed enough.

If you want to cast silver , do not anneal twice, and if something stays in the mold and that must be burnt because no good …

Casting plants  and flower  bouquets
 
One must cast them as soon as they are picked because they wilt and dry out. Dunk them, therefore, right away in good spirits  and then put them in your sand mold , soaked like snakes . There is nothing to be released from the mold s  because while the mold s are heating up, the plant  material burns away, which does not happen with animals, which have bone s. For bouquets, the sand must be finer than for snakes  because, if it were thick, it would crush the flower .

  
 burn the plant s, flower s, and animal  parts that are remaining. Afterward, they must be cleaned and the cinder  removed. Then reheat them until  they are red for casting . Reheat in the beginning with some charcoal  lit over a gentle fire, and put your core mold s down flat on the charcoal  encircled by bricks . Molding frames  are reheated on a grate .


Core molding  the same sand for wax  images, lead  medals, and similar things
Make sure that these are well emptied. If they are not, fill them  with wax , which will not be it, and then smear your wax  or lead  images with a very thin and light layer of olive  oil  in such a way that the oil  does not give any thickness or body to the medal. Then heat it with a little spirits  and, when it is lukewarm, wet the oiled  medal, because if the water  is cold, it will resist the oil . It will not hold on to it. After, cast your plaster  sand,matton , and alum . Wet it on top having placed your image on clay  mold in the shape of a mandore and having given it some contour to give the necessary thickness. These medals oil  and rub against themselves in this way with the spirits  because they are firm and hard, and they would not ready to be taken out of the mold , which is resistant like real animals , which are soft and flexible.
 
When you have soaked your sand, do not cast on the middle of the mold , but on the edge so that the sand gently settles, so that the first cement  be clear and thick afterwards. If your soaked sand sizzles like water  falling in a mold , it is a sign that it is too light. Make it, then, of an average thickness. 


Casting gold  and silver 
 
The molds  must be fire-red and ablaze when you cast gold  or silver  in them, or when you burn flower s and bouquet s. The gate must not be very big where the thing being cast enters because the matter will flow better without disturbing the mold , and does not become so filled with bubbles. 


A way to enamel  very fine gold rose  leave s and others
 
After you have cast or beaten in gold  the thin rose  leaves  or other things, if you want to enamel  them, you must solder or braze your fine gold  leaves onto silver  strips, which will strengthen them to support the enamel . After the things has been enameled , put the work in aqua fortis  , which will eat away the silver  and leave all the gold  with its enamel . For this, the gold  must have been passed…

Casting snake s in all season s
Snake s hide underground during winter . Some people feed them a lot in barrel s filled with earth  and covered with manure . Other people make several mold s in summer  because you can make four or five mold s with one single snake . Other people cast  long, natural snakes  without coils, using common plaster , annealed as said, with a core and two half-molds. Then they cast it in wax , that way they have a snake  as twisted as they want. Then they cast metal  as it is said.

If, while twisting your wax  snake, some parts become undone, you can rework it if you remove the drips from the molded wax .

Tin  and lead  mixture
For fine herb s, flower s and greeneries . You need more than 3 parts of tin  for one part of lead . If this material is thick and fat, you need 3 parts lead . Heat the mostly tin  mixture, which must become red and very hot. When you want to cast , remove your crucible  from the fire, and add two or three grains of resin  for one and a half or two pound s of lead  or tin . With the resin , also some fat looking-glass tin , the size of a hazelnut  with its shell, mix and cast. Make sure you have more metal  than you need; some metal  should be set aside. If you haven't enough metal , keep cast ing and finish your cast , it will set, however it will not be so neat. Dip your mold  into water , and dismantle your mold  carefully with a point . Make an elongated cast  in order not to damage anything. If you mold  something very thin, you must make your cast  with mostly tin .

If you want to cast lead  or tin  as a core with the sand above mentioned, reheat your mold  once only if there is nothing to be burnt inside. But if there are flower s or animal s to be burnt inside the mold , reheat it twice. However do not reheat the second cast  for as long as the first cast  for lead  and tin . As for gold  and silver , those must be red when you cast . For lead  and tin , let them cool down until you can dip your finger   into the cast  without burning yourself. The cast  must be warm.

Copper  and tin cast s
For red copper  you must add sal ammoniac . It will clean it and remove the crust when melted. Some people add big pieces of new leather . Other add peels of mice  feet . Other add melted common salt  only, or salt  melted with saltpeter . The main ingredients are sal ammoniac  and also a little bit of tin , depending on the cast  you want to do. Copper  is harder to cast  than tin . But when it is melted it runs better, even if alloyed with tin . Add a quarter of copper  to tin  and mix it like copper . Calamine  especially makes it run well.

A way to mold flower s and herb s
It is necessary to pick them in full bloom and color, and only pick them, if it is possible, when you are ready to mold them so that they will not wilt. Or if you need to carry them from afar, put their stems in a bottle of water , or even better in wine . Start with making a wax  stick pointed like a big peg, of a size adapted to what you want to cast, as you see in the margin, marked A. At the bottom of this peg, put and prick a bit of iron  wire, rather thick and strong. And at the pointed end of the big peg, you will fit your flower  stem or your herb .  This done, set it aside.  Arrange your clay  circle and outline as you did for the snake s, in the shape of a mandore  according to the size of your herb . Then take the herb  you have prepared to be cast, as we have taught you, and wet and moisten it daintily with good spirits  with a brush . Then place the wire end through through the end of the earthen  mold, shaped like a mandore , so that the wax  peg, where the herb  is, touches the edge of the earthen mandore . And arrange your herb  that lies thusly so that it remains in the middle of said mandore -shaped mold, without touching any of the side. So that the sand that you put in the mold will be of equal thickness everywhere, and will be two finger s higher than your flower . And having made sure that the wire is secure, quickly throw your wet sand  that will be much clearer than the one used for serpents, in the mandore -shaped mold, and the quicker the better, so that your spirits  do not evaporate.  And adjust your mixture with a bit of essence of sal ammoniac , unlike the one for serpents.  And when you make sand especially for casting your bouquets, mix in a bit of feather alum , this will only make it better. In this way, your mold will be in one piece and it will not be necessary to separate it, but you will have to separate it from the clay  once it will have set.  Let it dry. And then fire it again until the herbs are burnt. Note that if the herb you want to cast has a strong stalk and stem, you can cast it lying down, as said. But if it is fine and delicate, plant up standing up with the wax  peg  so that the sand will always raise it up, it being very clear.  Do not forget to arrange two vent holes with two small stick s, which will start at the bottom of the cast, which is the pointed end of the wax  peg.

If the flower s are so delicate that they come off the top when you are putting in the wet sand , you can stop this and curtail it with a net  sewed onto the mold with a needle .
  
The more delicate the flower  is, the clearer the sand must be.
This is a core mold.

To make the ashes of flowers  and herbs  leave molds 
Some people put quicksilver  inside. But, if it is a little work, or fine & delicate foliage, that only has a slender issue, they make two errors: the first, that quicksilver  by its heaviness can destroy some delicate tract inside in coming out, the other, that some bit will always linger inside that will make other metals  sour & inhibit the perfection of the casting. It is true that if it is to empty the mold  of some large animal that has big conduits & passages through which the quicksilver  can easily exit, like of a bird or a serpent, one can indeed put some amount of quicksilver  to break the calcinated bones of the animal in escaping, because of which the said ☿  will empty out & not remain at all.

The asparagus  stalk is so hard that most often it perseveres as charcoal. Because of this, do it rather dried out or wet it with sulfur oil  & turpentine , or indeed cast the little branches separately & solder them onto a fat stalk drawn through with a wire.

If the burnt thing has left behind some filth or ash, let it cool down a little, & with an iron wire  wrapped in cotton  that can bend with the cavities that you have, investigate. Clean & blow to a fault, either with a soft brush  or a clipped brush .

Daisies 
They can be cast well in gold . But if you want to enamel  them, you have to make them by hand & enamel  them & then attach them. Otherwise, the leaves  would be so pressured that it would encrust the enamel .

Sand  that has already been used
Do not cast it. But because it is mixed with stone allum , you can use it in the mixture of other things & it can serve in place of brick .

Core molding wax  figures or lead  medals
Rub them with oil  with a brush . But be sure that it be so softly that your medal be barely wiped with it & that it hardly appear to have been greased. After rub it with spirits  and heat the water  with which you will wet your sand , that of plaster , brick  & alum , so that being sort of lukewarm when you cast it, the oil  will not refuse it, as it does with cold water, & do not forget to moisten your sand  with it, mixing it always with a little sal ammoniac .

Medals molded  in this way are very fine.

Snakes' blood 
If you have to cut some snake inside a mold  in order to burn it, cut it far from the intake of the mold  so that no blood  at all remains, because it makes a crust that afterwards would not be taken away by the same quicksilver  & removes impressions from your mold .

Snails 
Those which are found in the ocean  and similarly those in which certain small crabs dwell are very beautiful for grottoes, if they have been rid of the first layer of their shell with aqua fortis  , because they really look to be made of mother-of-pearl .

For removing flaws and flashing from things molded  in a core mold 
If your molds  are made of good plaster  which withstands fire, they will not crack, especially if they are squeezed well between two tables with presses  or in a pot  filled with ashes  or sand, and, therefore, they will not develop flaws. If they they develop some flaws , you can remove them with a burin  called chaple   which has a tip like a small chisel .

For grottoes
Stone s made from water called stuf ; charcoal ; the confection of tin  and pure brass ; paper  ground up and mixed with ground up glass ; cork ; heated parchment , and white coral , all of them are appropriate for making grottoes. But, once dry, bizarre pieces of wood , which the bizarre pieces of wood  are found in the forests and among regular  mushrooms and potirons  growing on  trees, are better than all of them because they are light. Mix in with small pieces of looking-glass tin  which have a shiny luster. Grind in a little of a different kind of marcasite  in order to clean the earth  away, then powder the work, which is very beautiful. If there is no spring in the grotto, glue all of this with strong glue , and then the work is done. You must show all kinds of mines . The sulfurous marcasites  which do not have a grain but are even like looking-glass tin  are very beautiful.
Red copper  is found sometimes mixed with certain brittle lumps which are pulverized under the hammer , which are very beautiful pulverized on grottoes.

Looking-glass tin 
If one ounce of looking-glass tin   is put in with it pure tin  , pure tin  whitens and becomes firm, that is, i ℥  of looking-glass tin  in one lb  of pure tin .

Casting in box molds 
The same sand that was used in the reheated noyaulx , composed of plaster , brick  and alum de plume   as is said, is excellent for casting in box molds , and I have experienced it thus: I crushed the pieces which had come out of core molds  in a mortar , dragging the pestle , because this sand is very doulx . I did not pass it through the sieve , because the alum de plume   mixed throughout, which binds it, would not pass; but I ground finely upon marble  what seemed to me too coarse. And having prepared it thus, I moistened it with sal ammoniac water , made of sal ammoniac , as much as the size of two walnuts  , in a bottle of common water  the same size as a bottle  in which one boils tisane , or in a good pot  of water  so that you find the water  fairly salty. I mixed throughout half a glass  of sal ammoniac , two silver spoonfuls  of spirits . Having thus moistened the sand in such a way that it took hold well, nevertheless coming apart easily, I sprinkled my medal with pulverized charcoal  with a file  to rid it of oil , and all other grease . It is necessary to avoid them, for they would hinder good stripping. I blew on my medal & molded it, and the female part of the box mold  once filled, I marked & made a line on the reverse & edge of the medal, & on the nearby sand as well. In order that the second box mold  take the imprint thereupon to indicate the place for making the cast, once filled the female part of the box mold once filled  I uncovered the outline of the medal and pounced the whole side with pulverized charcoal , and then filled the male part with sand. Once mad  I separated the box mold  and did not hit the corners of the medal to make it strip, because that knocks the sand and makes it crumble. Rather I struck the back of the box mold , retaining the obverse of the medal on the bottom, and it molded very neatly. If it had not stripped thus, I would have waited to remove it until the box mold  had been dried out over fire. I lit a row of charcoals  between two little trivets  of iron  in the form that you see, and put the back & reverse of box molds  thereupon, & the imprint on top,  
 because in this way, they dry out gently. And if, by chance, they should crack from being too moistened, it is on the back that they take the harshest fire, & the imprint remains safe & whole.

For the best, it is necessary to reheat the sand that is used in the noyau  rather than used it in the box mold , until it no longer contracts.

Excellent sand Take a little of the same sand, the finest that you can, for covering the medal.

For medals & flat things, the true heat of lead  & tin  is when it is melted gently.

Note that I filled the box mold  before pressing it, and did not hit it, but rather pressed it with the strength of my hands  alone, because hitting it makes it go awry. Secure your box mold  that it does not shift at all, & if you put some moistened sand under it, it will only hold in place more firmly.

Make the gate that it is not too thick, so as not to overcharge the medal, but wide enough near the medal that it embraces a third part. Do not forget the vents.

Drying box molds  is to keep them from humidity, that they no longer smoke, once having nevertheless been very hot.
Recuire  is to redden the box mold, which is done for gold  and for silver .

  When I saw that they did not smoke anymore, & scratching the back & the front of the casting & having found that they are rough & firm & hard on both sides, which is a good sign of their being quite dry, I leave them to cool down. I took some fine tin , one lb., & one ounce of fine & new lead . I melted it in a crucible just until it was a bit red. Being in this way quite hot & ready to cast & no sooner, I smoked every side of my box frame with the smoke of a tallow candle  & pressed & cast & everything. I set my box frame, well joined, in the press. I drew my crucible from the fire. I let it sit a bit to quench the redness of the crucible's bottom. And wanting to cast, I threw in around two or three grains of rosin, and about the measure of a bean of looking-glass tin  & blended it & stirred the crucible a little and cast. And the medal came out as neat as the original. I smoked it with the candle & cleaned it with my coat .

Always cast through the foot of the medal because the head, which is lower, will come out better, and make the casting somewhat long. And when you cast several medals in a large box frame, they will come out better.

Notice about everything above
 Good tin  is that which is hard as silver  & soft nevertheless. If your work is fine, it must be almost all tin  & alloyed as is said.
Looking-glass tin  must not be mixed until the instant that you want to cast.
 Nor must the forms be smoked until then.
 If the sand  shrinks in the box frame, this means that it must be reheated & turned red on the fire.
Good sand  when moistened does not stick at all to the hand when pressed.
The perfect sand  for the box frame is the asphalt  found in Germany, which is soft as wet flour , & almost all the rest are lumpy.
Nota that the casting must be fine & hardly thick so that it does not work the material at all, & must not exceed the thickness of a grain of wheat  taken crossw-wise, likewise for tin  that is going to be cast finely. For lead , a little thicker. There is no need to make air vents very large & deep either.

The sand  that you use à noyau for the said mixture is excellent for a box frame. But in washing, crushing & reheating it several times, its nature will be corrupted & it will no longer be fit to be taken & molded en noyau .

Way to rework spat
You find an earth in Germany , the color of cooked plaster, but have long and soft filaments which are easy to handle. Because it is mixed with earth and rubbish, one pounds it roughly and forms little balls having soaked it previously in sal ammoniac water , following the above indication. Reheat these balls in a potter 's furnace. And then soak them  in the same water  again. Earth and filth will remain at the bottom, and pure aspalt , which is light, soft and malleable as soaked flour , sticks to water  and rises to the surface, making the water  cloudy. Pour this cloudy water  in another pot. Letting it rests, one empties the water  tilting the pot or taking the water  out using a sponge. And the pureaspalt  remains at the bottom. Dry it and use it in frame, having moistened it with sal ammoniac water  Then soak it into sal ammoniac water , and use it for frames in which it shrinks when reheated or dried, that is to say that one needs to reheat it again on a good fire and reddens it, as for example for medals and flat things. Use this one, because it is the best of all for gold , silver , copper , lead , latten , and tin . Because it withstands fire and reddens whenever you need, without deteriorating. The more you use it the better it is, and does not change. In the beginning it is white, and while using it turns grey. However make sure to put aside the one that served for casting lead  and tin  and latten , because gold  would get brittle, and would not come out well. And even better, you will put some of this aside to use it for each metal. 

See Gesnerus, De lapidibus


It withstands 10 or 12 casts without deteriorating. It withstands fire and reddens. It is well suited for all metals. It is so resistant that if the frame is grooved, it holds.

spat  almost does not set, even if it is reheated and even if  it is a kind of plaster , which you can easily break with your fingers.

Excellent secret to mould in hollow and very delicately in fine gold 
Cast your animal or lizard  or other thing with the above mentioned sand, with alloyed silver  and it will come out very neat. But make sure to mould it hollow, or at least leave a small hole in it or in another place. Then gild your animal with fine gold , as much homogeneously as possible, three, four or five times, until your gold  becomes as thick as a piece of paper  or anything similar. And the scales will always come out evenly. Then dip your cast into good aqua fortis , which will corrode the alloyed silver  through the hole, and gold  will remain hollow, light and wonderful.

Stamped medals made from wax 
You can mold your relief with wax  mixed with a bit of resin  to make it harder and firmer, whatever relief that you wish, either an animal or a medal.  And then, fashion a hollow out of this relief in brass  or copper . Or mold your wax   in relief and strike it in a sheet of tin .  And fill your final product  with lead , and heat it. Try to use  blades of stone leaf  to make the hollow for lizards &

Sand  for casting gold 
Take common sand  made of alum, plaster  and brick , according to the composition above-mentioned. Add to it some more feather alum . And add as well something a third part of crocum ferri . However whatever quantity is never harmful, because crocum ferri   is the one that makes gold  shiny and makes it come out of its cast easily. But it is best if your crocum  has previously been left for three days and three nights in the furnace of glassworkers , in a flat box, where it is not very thick so that it will reheat better.

You can easily cast gold  with the common sand  of goldsmiths , but make sure  that you add some substance that makes it runny. Before the invention of crocum , one cast flowers in silver , but not in gold. This has only been known in Germany for forty years.
Sublimate  is often used by goldsmiths  for gold . Some people add sulphur , but they are all wrong, because sulphur  makes things sour, even if it heats well. , And sublimate  gets agitated,boils and bubbles. It is very good to clean gold  because its exaltation draws the bad stuff  out that disappears in the smoke. But to heat up gold , and to keep the heat, there is only the color of verdigris , salt of ammoniacum , saltpeter , and borax . This makes it runny and you will be able to throw in a branch from the Santoinge.

Nightingale
It is necessary for the cage, made like those for larks found in barns and lined with green fabric, to be made with something that slides out from underneath, so that you can refresh the dirt everyday, because the nightingale loves it, and mix in some ants. You can carry an ant-hill with its dirt in a barred full of earth, and keep them there and they will lay their eggs and in this way, you can always have access to them when you need them, should you enjoy feeding nightingales. When you caught it, it was fat and full.  And to keep it in such good shape, on the first day, you must take it in you hand and open its beak and place in it, using a sharp twig, some mutton heart or other delicate flesh, chopped up not too finely, so that the belly does something, and make sure that it does not get smaller or thinner, until it has gotten used to it.  And feed it in this way three or four times a day, and also give it something to drink. The next morning, you will give him in his cage some well-minced flesh mixed with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, and change this mixture two or three times a day, because it will not eat it if it is hard and not fresh. And If it goes half a day without eating, you must feed it as before and do so until

eat by itself. And so that he likes it better, you can add to the meat and the egg some mealworm, because nightingales love them.

Crocum ferri 
It is excellent applied to wounds to stop the bleeding. The best one is made of needle filings .
Crocum ferri  hardens moulds that have been reheated, the more feather alum  is added, the softer and pliant they become.

Anatomy
You must skin the animal and boil it. Or skin it and put it into quicklime .

Making silver  runny
If it is for a large work, arsenic  and pulverized tartar  thrown into melted silver , makes the silver  runny. This is enough for silver.   But for subtle work, you need bronze, filings, copper,  even antimony , sublimate , all neatly ground. All of this makes a mass that does not get smaller.  If the plaster  is good, you do not need to add crocum  for silver , but one puts in more feather alum . It is also necessary to add melted common salt , and some saltpeter  and the aforementioned drugs: arsenic, tartar, bronze, copper filings, antimony  &

Flowers can also be kept in their same beauty in distilled vinegar  in a vase, well-sealed so it takes no draft, well-sealed with wax  and mastic . Carnations and roses, the residue of common vinegar  makes them rot.  If the sand  makes dust, and sticks to the flowers and hardly comes off with a brush, it is no good. The most lean is the best.

Keeping dried flowers in the same condition all year
River sand , that is washed by the current of water, is good when strained in a cloth to make the powder compact.
This is a rare secret, and which is pleasing for decorating tables, rooms, studies out of season when winter denies you flowers. Be advised to pick them when they are in full vigor and still growing, because if you take them when no longer in bloom or when they are starting to wilt, they will not keep.  Having therefore chosen them, take some sand , the leanest and driest you can find, that must be very well ground, like the one goldsmiths  use to sand enamel , or like the one used  for engraving. But this sand  must not be dusty at all, nor must it stay on your hand or leave a trace when you have ground or poured it, because it is

Make sure your box is well sealed so that the sand  does not get out. Keep it uncovered in sunlight and keep it away from the evening dew, and the moisture of the night, and cover it and keep it in a dry place.

You can not put these aforementioned flowers in big vases, because if you want to take one out, you will take the whole bunch with it. 

Be advised to not pick your flowers when it is rainy or humid, but when the sun has been shining on them.

 a sign that there is some humidity, and if the flower was also somewhat watery it would rot. Nor should it be   too rough, because its weight would burden the flower and make it lose its original shape. Once you have chosen it as needed, take a box  and inside this start by making a small mound of sand on top of which you will lay the stalk of the flower flat, so that the flower touches neither the bottom nor the edges of the box  but remains in the air. Then add more   sand on the stalk so that it remains firm and fixed. Finally take some of the same sand and pulverize and sprinkle it finely with two fingers   on the flower, imitating the flow of an hourglass  . And once the flower is   half covered or so, strike with your fist   the table on which the box  is laid, so that the sand drops and enters everywhere. Finally cover the entire flower and lay other flowers in order, one over the other, as many as the box  will hold. After you have arranged them thus, put the box  out in hot sun  for several days  . And while the flower is drying, the sand that is packed together, by continuously holding it, does not allow it to shrivel and shrink. On the contrary, it needs to dry remaining in the same state as when you put it there. But to that effect take care you chose knapweed s, marigold s, the yellow meadow flowers  called ranunculus   or palta lupina  , amaranth s, and similar flowers, such as broom  and others that you will know from experience.

The sand that goldsmith s use to rub enamel s and the white one that glassworker s use and any thin sand that does not set, you put through a sieve  made of horsehair  because it needs not be too thin. Then dry the sand well in the sun  for several days   in order to remove its humidity, and ventilate it as you would do with wheat  so that the dust becomes separated from it. After taking that dust, well dried, use it as you know.
Pansies  are preserved in the same way.

Keeping fruits throughout the year  
You need to pick them in calm and quite dry weather & by the stem, without touching  the fruits with your hand , and to put them into glass  bottles  that have wide necks, such as tall glass jars  for preserves. Protect them with straw  or something else so that they may not break, and seal them well with wax  so that they may not breathe. And if they have glass  lids well sealed with wax , it will be all the better. Put them in a case  and put this in the well , or in the cellar , or in a vat or plot of earth  full of water .

Because wherever the hand touches  them they will rot, and it is even best not to breathe on them. You can also put vine leaves  with them.

Casting in silver 
You need to place the animals as said, and make up the same sand out of four parts plaster , two parts  refiredbrick , and one part  annealed stone alum . Mix it well, and once it is ready and you wish to mold, take three parts  of the aforementioned sand in the earthenware dish  from which the peasants eat their soup. Add pure annealed stone alum  that has been pulverized in the mortar , as much as you can grab with your four finger s and thumb  , or a small double handful . Then, mix well and mix in a little of sal ammoniac  and the remainder with common water + Which needs to be placed in the dish  rather than in the sand, which is put in the water , and not the water  in the sand 
 
And stir it with your spatula  so that it all becomes like a thick sauce or clear mustard . And having rubbed spirits on the animal with the brush , cast and blow, and beat the table to shake the mold  and do as with the others. Do not forget to put in crocum , because it prevents molds  from cracking, and it is appropriate for all metals .

Alloyed silver  is better for casting than fine silver , provided it is soft.

The stone alum  needs be well pulverized and well mixed.
Sal ammoniac  gets along well with gold  and silver .
Brass  is the enemy of gold  and works well withsilver .

Silver used  to cast
It is not pure but alloyed silver , and it does not become perfectly white on the fire because they goldsmiths   whiten it after the melting to clean up the welding marks that occur when an animal needs to be attached to another or when it needs repairing. The process  is similar with teston silver  and all alloyed silver  as long as it is soft and good.
Before starting to cast in silver , in order to coat all round and strengthen your mold s, you should use earth  that can withstand fire, such as this sandy earth  mixed with cloth waste  which founders  use to cast their canons, or any good lute  that can withstand fire. They need to all be red and to be tied with iron  wire .
Rather than anneal the mold s, have the mixture necessary so that the silver  runs.
If goldsmiths  knew the material to make silver  run in their work, they would buy it in quantity. Some buy it five sols for a denier.

I have used silver  from the capital.

Before luting and strengthening the mold s for gold  and silver  with the said earth , the cast and the vents must be made and the mold s must have been annealed and made quite red to burn the animals, flowers and herbs that are inside. The ashes in the mold s should be cleaned thoroughly. Once the mold s are quite clean and ready, lute them and bind them with iron  wire . Anneal them straight away until they are quite red.

Fixing different animals
When you discover some twisted lizard s which bite each other are the most difficult thing to mold because of the number of their feet and because of the tip of their tail which are very fine, steady the parts which are uncovered and which look like suspended in mid air, that way the second cast will not vary anything. If you need to steady the parts hanging in mid air, take a bit of wax , rub it and elongate it on a table , make it big needle shaped, then cut the part you need with a hot iron  wire  then join where it is necessary. Steady also the part which does not stick to the mould  (when you uncover the half of the womb) with some wax  with the point of a knife  @, joined and melted with the wire . When you cast, pour only to the spot and at the edge of the wax  which being attached to the animal will melt but still lead the cast towards it without damaging anything. This is a secret.
 One can arrange embracing snake s, but only small ones.

Flower in the mouth of a snake 
If you want to put a flower in the mouth of a snake  or a branch of a herb which guards against its bite, take the best arranged little branch you can find, and display its stalk into its mouth. Then put two little pieces of wax   around the stalk of the herb. Melt a bit of wax  with the point of a warm iron  wire , while you are closing the jaws of the animal with your hand . And then you can cut the head to make it burn with the flower. If the herb is strong enough, it will stay in the same position by itself but if the flower is light, like wormwood , which droops, the dampness of the sand will lift it up, make it swim and stand by itself, without any support, as well as if you had put some thread  under it passing through with a needle .
     
 122v
Cleaning the bowl  and the spoon  that one uses to temper sand
Be very careful to clean, vigorously & quickly after casting, your bowl  & your spatula  or spoon  with which you temper your sand, because if it dries, it crumbles & falls into the fresh sand & makes a hole or fault get made. Also, when the mold  gets reheated, these little pieces will chip & flake off & prevent neat casting. 

Molding hollow
Wax  on its own cools down too rapidly & does not spread well everywhere, & tallow  holds its heat & spreads everywhere; but is not good on its own. But when wax  and tallow  are mixed the work behaves well. The bodies of crawfish  & other small animals can easily be molded hollow, but as for the legs, it will be troublesome.

The first part of the mold  that is first cast on the plate of clay , cracks more easily in the fire than the second.

Molding medals and flat things
You are not limited to making the gate with legs thus 
 
, but rather in this way 
  
, which embraces the medal well. For the other way with legs is only done to accommodate more delicate works and the other, which is wide and in one piece works better for flat medals. But take heed that all gates need to be very thin close to the medal & so as to say not as thick as the medal, if it is not very thin like paper. And then, from the medal out towards the opening of the gate, make it thicker and thicker for it works better thus. If the gate is thick at the entry to the medal, the work never comes out very well. Make that despuys  from the middle to the top of the gate be moderately thick, & from the same middle to the bottom very thin.  Do not forget to makes grooves in au hau  the top of your gate to prevent the metal  from spreading furiously.

Take these ingredients, the best ones you can find. Weigh them as described above, and crush them separately, keeping your face covered, over the nose & the mouth, from the eyes down, in order to avoid the exhalations of arsenic , sublimate , and orpiment . Mix them well all together, then put them in a good crucible that must be so large that the ingredients can have at least the fourth or fifth part empty. Cover the crucible with a good tile, precisely adapted in its roundness so as to fit the opening. And having connected it tightly with wire from top to bottom and around the sides, lute it with manure  or founder’s earth ,that artillery founders  use. And in this, be careful & diligent, & do not forget to mix in crushed glass  throughout the lute to fortify your crucible, in a way that it takes no air, for the mixture would be worth scarcely anything, because the 4 five  last ingredients would be exhaled. 

Note that you need to lute your crucible  well, so that the ingredients do not take air, and would not be exhaled.


Lute well your crucible , so that it does not break, for if it breaks, the materials evaporate & the fumes from it are dangerous. If within 12 hours it has not melted and intermingled, it will not be well made. 
Goldsmiths  who know about these things sell a denier   of this for 5 sols   to other goldsmiths , & especially to those who make dishware and great works, for at the end of their works, they can solder over the first solder by the means of this mixture, in general all those who want to mold and cast something delicate. This mixture should not be divulged, so that it is not abused.

The grain is like broken steel 
 
 123v
 Your lute once dry, put your crucible in an four a vent  in the early morning, & at the beginning, give low fire, as much as you need to heat your crucible as to let the fury of the saltpeter  pass gently. Then, little by little & with judgement intensify the fire. And y   leave in the fullness of this your ingredients for 12 hours, or a natural day.  Make at each go a good quantity of this mixture to not have to repeat it too often, because the fumes, which are dangerous, could hurt you. And before working with it, take a good piece of buttered toast in the morning, and hold in your mouth the said butter , or zedoary , or gold  coins, and ada   cover your face with a towel from the eyes down. From this mass, the crust will serve to make run  clarify the great works of  the silver  from the metallic mass like snakes  & similar things  when it starts to melt. But  And then, the grain that will be at the bottom of the crucible  should be reserved for principally delicate flowers and herbs  putting a little in the melted silver  when you want to cast it, However it is necessary to always put a little of this grain in the silver  when you want to cast  it is melted and when you are ready to cast  as you do thus for fine tin  on copper , & for looking-glass tin  on lead  and on tin . And just as looking-glass tin  makes lead  and tin  too brittle if you put in too much, likewise the grain composed of the above-mentioned ingredients would make your silver too brittle if l  you were to put in too much, and obscure it.  This above-mentioned composition will suffice you for a long time, when it has been on a low  low fire for a whole day at the beginning & intensified degree by degree until the end. Having thrown one load of charcoal, let it consume itself, & let your crucible  cool down. Then break it.  You will find two sheets & hard cakes in the crucible . The upper one looks stoned Once , once composed of salts ,sublimated & mixed together. The lower one is metallic, composed of fillings, aes ustum  & antimony , having very small grain. Pulverize the upper cake, made from salts , & put some in to lighten & clean the silver  and the metallic grain can be used to put into the melted metal.
Charcoal  fire

Or, after you have pestled your drugs  by a rustic, and having put them in your crucible, & the latter luted & dry as said & place into the furnace, have the fire managed by a boutique  boy, familiar with charcoal . 

One sells this metallic mass to silversmiths  to soften their solder, because when melting brass  exhales. And with a little of this mixture, they solder over the other solder.

Hairy animals and very fragile and thin flowers 
Hairy animals are difficult to mold because hairs raise up & come out looking intermingled & in clumps. At the beginning, it is necessary to keep it flat with a drying agent & that makes it firmer.  And in this, the best thing to use is wheat oil , with which you will dawb it. Once cast, you will be able to repair it. The bodies of butterflies  and herbs  that have a stem  & leaves  that are flocked with capricious & downyhairs  need to be daubed with the same oil  to keep these flocks flat; likewise  flowers  that have very delicate & thin leaves  because dry wheat oil  makes them and rigid and firm. And if someone brags about molding anything presented to them, give them the downy head of the herb called dandelion  to cast or a pappus , which comes from the seeds of burdock  & takes flight at the slightest sigh of wind.

Noyaulx  for molding hollow
Animals of gold  & silver  are generally cast hollow to avoid weightiness, and costs as well, if they are not quite small. But in order to make the core & the noyau , the mold needs to be freshly molded and not dry.

Spider  web
It comes undone in water  & because of this, cannot be molded in a noyau , but one casts the spider  and then one draws the web filaments  that they make in the fields stretched between blades of grass   on some carton  with a stylus. One makes around it an edge of paper , glued to the carton  & one casts with tin  mixed with very little lead .

Fine gold 
There is a kind of gold  which, even though it is very fine & unalloyed & has been passed through aqua fortis  & antimony , is however so brittle that it hardly withstands the hammer. And the composition of verdigris  mentioned above to make gold  flow, makes it as doux  as lead .

Rouge clair   @ enamel  
Fine gold  is unfavorable for it, for    on the former it is yellowish. But alloyed gold  is more favorable, such as that of escu  & pistolet . If Gold  in its pale color decays the enamel ’s hue. Ma  And for this occasion, once cut, one puts it back on the fire to give it a reddish color to make enamels  beautiful. Otherwise, they are subdued.
There is  rouge clair  that once worn down with arene   loses its beauty.
Some rouge claire  is found with grains of gold  inside. And it is also the opinion of good goldsmiths  that the good one is made with gold .

Casting with gold 
Molds are recooked better & more surely than otherwise in a closed fire, such as a pot   a reverberatory furnace . So that when goldsmiths want to cast some piece of important work d’or  e  that cost a lot to rough out in wax, they put the molds  in a pot  & recover them, & fill the pot with earth, sustaining the fire that holds them unified & tight. Then, they recook mold , earth  & pot  together and when everything is quite red, they cast the gold . Fine gold  does not run well, but rather alloyed gold .
Gold  and silver  do not become brittle: once entirely red and hot, dip them into water .
Gold  is a quarter heavier than lead .

When gold  reaches its perfect heat, it is green like an emerald .

Take care that where you want to cast with gold , there must not fall any lead , tin , or lime  thereof in the forge .

A way to make the gate for small female lizards 
Because you always have to make the gate by the tail, and that it is so delicate and thin that the casting scarcely  metal would flow with difficulty, especially when the tail is folded, roll wax  in little filaments of this size 
  
and apply some with the hot wire , as said, one at the end of the tail & others that correspond in the same way, from one end side  of the tail to the other, as you see depicted. But take heed to do it with the end of the hot iron  so that the end of the wax  scarcely touches the animal, for the sand of the second gate will not touch this part.  But make the end of the wax  arranges itself only at the end of the empty part of the first mold. Make as well channels of wax  around the legs &, around the contours of the body, which are a little long & they will serve as a trough for the molded thing. 
Follow here above   

When the tail, which is delicate and closer to the gate comes out well, the rest will also come out well.

The most important is that the ears of the snake  come out well-molded.

Your gate must be very thin at the entrance of the animal & of the thickness of a knife.
  
 125r

Plaster 
When you mold something in order to cast with wax , first mold only plaster , you mold with plaster that is  only reheated after it  has been pulverized. Because, once it  has been reheated on the stone  slab, the outside is burnt, and the inside remains nearly unburnt. Transparent grey plaster  is not strong, but the good one plaster   becomes white once it has been soaked, and it  sets well quickly. Nevertheless I have found the grey plaster   to be quite firm and hard after it has set, but it takes longer to work with it . Know the nature of each. You will never mold very neatly if you do not soak until it is quite clear and liquid, your plaster  or the core's sand . Soak it straight away after it has been reheated.

However, if you mold with plaster  that has been reheated once as said, coat the first mold well with oil . And when the second cast has set and you have prepared it, soak it in water  for a long time. And if it does not release, soak it in hot water , because cold water  hardens it.
Something  to know
And hot water  softens it plaster   more than cold water which  does not penetrate it plaster   as it does mixed plaster  because it plaster   is stronger and mixed plaster  is spongier. Medal s are cast from this powder ed, reheated plaster , and the medal s  will be waterproof as though they were varnish ed. In Germany, people hang these medal s on houses. See to it that the water  is very hot, and if the water  is boiling, it will not endanger it . All molds made  of plaster only or molds made of mixed plaster  are stripped from it.

Scimitars
Workers  from Damascus or from Hungary, neighbors to the Turks, separate iron  from the mine s with steel . And they cast the blades of the scimitar in sand  with this first steel that was  first casted from its mine . Afterwards, they the blades  cut other iron  without without great difficulty because all melted iron  is harder than soft iron  beaten into ...  and bars. Thus is the steel  of scimitars, but it is quite brittle. When someone takes the haft of a scimitar off, that person recognizes it  well by the tip in the haft which is cast in sand .

Hearing from afar
Make a small hole into the ground, put your ear against it during the night or during an equally quiet time, and you will easily hear the muffled sound.

Vipers and snakes

I molded a viper, which is much cleaner to cast than any other snake, because it has beautiful & very visible scales on the entire body & principally on the head and under the throat. It has a flat heat, a ruddy snout tending to deep carnation, & thick and short like horned aspic or like the top of a pig's snout, big jowls, eyes very close to the snout, and the mouth wide open where it has double canine teeth on each side coming out of a reed of flesh that covers them and turns back. It also has a reed of flesh in the throat like a dog's penis from which comes its stinger. Other snakes have a double row of teeth.


If you want to mold snakes with open mouth, you must cut off the head & leave it inside, because it will not be able to be stripped.

Molding turtles

Casting snakes & herbs and flowers is a strange matter, since the cavities that are between the two shells require several pieces. To cast in sugar  without making a casting, they are molded from plaster, as works for anything you like.

Plaster  to cast with wax 

When you want to cast in wax  in a plaster  mold, you must know this secret, that there is need that your mold be in hot water . The animal will never come out as clean as in metal, because wax  grips. But to rough out an animal as close to natural as possible in order to fix it afterwards, you have to remove all the scales, because the wax  will permeate them & will not be able to be stripped off. In molding the animal, take off the scales for wax , but on the contrary when not molding with wax  rub them against their grain so that they raise up, because then these animals sc. those not molded in wax and prepared in this way  will show better. Do not wait to strip off your wax until it is cooled down at all. But while it is a bit hot, after you have molded the first casting of the animal, uncover it halfway so that it be stripped in so doing. And having as much in one mold as in the other, make very many large castings holding on to the animal in order to fortify them ...  stripping, & afterwards you'll cut it.

Molding fruits and animals in sugar
Sugar  is fatty, and, with it, round things and large muscles are cast well but fine and delicate things are cast with  difficulty. However, try well-purified sugar . The plaster  mold must be soaked in water  for a full night or a full day before casting sugar  so that it the mold  is saturated with water  and does not soak up the syrup the sugar  mixture . The plaster  mold must also be stripped very well from it the sugar , because sugar  is aigre and brittle. Thus, do not cast anything with sugar  which is not stripped easily from it, and which can not be neatly molded in two parts to open as will be needed. If you want to mold a grape, you must get it when it is very fresh; because if it is withered, it the cast  will look the same. See to it, thus, that you make your molds in the natural season for each thing fruit . Grapes that one wants to cast in sugar  are man-made, either with wax  or earth  or with grapes molded with melted wax , on some dish plaste & chose pleine  in a way so that they are pressed closely together and easily stripped from it. And only a half of the grapes  should be molded. Or, if you have some of those grapes called chauches or sauvignons which have well-pressed grapes, set half of the grapes in the dish of clay , and cast on the other half, and if any grape is not stripped from it, pluck it out. Note that a grape whose grapes are set apart and separated cannot mold well in either sugar  or metal  because the ends of the cluster are so fine. Similarly, if the grape is kept, that it cannot hold the bunched grapes. Therefore, a hollow should be cast, which you will not be capable of if the grape is not close together and without having them spread apart.

to cast and brittle, and it  breaks when dry
+  In order to mold pears and apples in sugar , do not cast. Rather, fill half of the mold, and then join the two halves , and keep turning it  until the sugar  is solidified and cold. Do not mix anything in the mold except the reheated plaster , as you know.

The mold needs to have been soaked in cold water  for one full day and night and the mold  must be damp when you cast in sugar .

The sign that the syrup  or the melted sugar  has boiled enough in the water  for casting fruits is when it makes threads when shaking it. And if it passes this point, it will not be good because it will make it  damp. If the sugar  corrodes itself, throw a bit of amidin  in the mold or rub it with an almond .

Crocum ferri 
It is made more quickly from iron rust  than filings , because if you have good vinegar , it will bubble on contact with rust  as if it were boiling, as if it were on fire, if you use filings it will not bubble up unless it is placed on the fire or warm ashes.  However when you have put your filings  through vinegar , and it has evaporated, and heated up and made it very warm, should you do this all for a second time, the vinegar  will be a lot stronger and your crocum  will be much more subtle and red.  Those who use it to cast in gold  buy it for forty or fifty sols per ounce.
It does not harden molds, and when you scrape the mold  you cannot tell that it is harder.  But it does make the mold more thinner, and it absorbs and attracts gold  better.

Plaster 
You can mold with it as large a piece as you wish. But if you make a mold upon large works and pieces of wood , it will not release cleanly unless you lather your wood  with very hot wax .  Because the wood  absorbs and drinks, and because of this, it drinks up the plaster , which means it does not come out cleanly. You can assume the same thing will happen for any other large piece of wax . But the cure for this is to lather the work that you wish to cast in plaster  with very hot wax .  In this way, it will not absorb, and will release very neatly.
If the plaster  shrinks, it will always make flaws, look for harder plaster   and rather than casting it, press your molds well.
If it shrinks, it is not good plaster. 

Plants that are difficult to burn in the noyau
Any herb that has a hard stem, like wood , is very difficult to burn in the noyau, such as asparagus, thyme, and other similar things, because they remain as solid coal  in the small conduits, and if they are not reduced to ashes, it is not possible to remove them from the mold.  In this case, some reheat them two or three times.  Others in mixing some herbs together in the mold, pass through the herbs and the earth  circle, which is there to receive the tempered sand.
This is not due to the fact that those herbs have stems with lines in them because rosemary burns well.  This is due to the nature of certain herbs.
 
 127r
 some thread, as much to secure the herbs so that they do not rise when you throw in your clear sand , as to give them some circulation when they are reheated.  Because by doing this the thread burns away and leaves some empty space around the herbs which acts as vents, and places for the air to escape, and places for the air to enter so that they burn more easily; because what keeps them carbonized, is when they burn in a closed fire with no empty spaces because of the fine sprigs.  Therefore try to enlarge the main stem with a bit melted wax  and leave it to cool.  Then mold it.  And when the wax  melts, it will leave the main stem sitting comfortably and almost loosely so that it burns better. Or you could apply some petrol oil , sulphur , turpentine , brick oil , or similar things, or with aqua fortis  or spirits , or make you sand  with . Or make your sand  with crocum filings  of iron lumps  or iron esmeri  which allow for several days of high fire.
Animal bones are not as difficult to burn and reduce to cinders, because their flesh being burned, the bones remain loose and the heaviness of quicksilver  makes them break and be crushed, being calcinated and burnt.

Asparagus always remains carbonized like little pins.  Try to the take asparagus and thyme when they start to grow, so that the stem is still tender.

Plaster  mold for wax 
When your plaster  mold is done and dried, be sure that your mold comes off cleanly because it sometimes happens that the animal, having been wounded or having lost weight or having withered, has wrinkles where plaster  can get in the scales.  Having not been rendered well, the animal will attack itself and break and will never be perfect. Be also advised to make your casts for wax  very big.  In this way, your casts will not be too thick. They are done when the mold of both sides is done and when the animal 
  has been removed from the mold.

Founder's earth
This is boulvene earth mixed in with dung or hairs which withstands fire, of which you must always have a large stock hanging around for dawbing the molds that you use to cast in silver and that need reheating.  Those where you burn flowers or animals do not need dawbing, unless they have been left to stand once they have been reheated, and once they have been cleaned of any bones and ash that might have remained inside. And having removed the clamps, you open the two halves to see if they have any cracks. Because there is some plaster that does not harden as much in the fire as another one would. Others create crusts on the things that remain to be burned inside.  And all of these are imperfections that you must avoid, either by giving the animal a bath of spirits before pouring your soaked sand, or by putting in more or less brick sand  or alum, or by reheating the brick to higher temperature, or by instead of mixing in brick, mixing in broken bits of crucibles and similar things that resist fire well.  Having therefore reheated your mold to burn what is inside, leave it to cool. And if it is neat and unbroken put the clamps on again, and dawb with the aforementioned earth, that is called of the founders , dust it with a bit of sifted ashes and leave it to strain. But beware not to dawb your if they are not cold.  Those in which you cast silver, where nothing needs burning inside, only need, when the cast and the vents are made, to be dawbed and reheated once.  Do not dawb the part of the mold in which you want to cast, but leave it uncovered like the openings of the vents.
The molds should crack at the first reheating, because then  they will not crack at the second reheating anymore.
The smallest molds reheat more quickly, therefore take the ones that have finished reheating first when you cast, because you can put several in your furnace at the same time  to reheat.
First light the coals in the forge, or in any other place that is close, and having placed your molds on a layer of good embers, not burning too much, in order to have a slow fire in the beginning, then add in little by little coals that are half lit to the forge.

Earth, of the kind used to braise or solder, which is sandy clay earth.  Or else clay mixed with sand after having been dried and sieved, and then composed, is good to dawb your molds. Because this type of earth melts rather than cracks.  And any earth that melts cannot be lacking in this.

Use a wire to bind.
 
Dawb very thickly your molds, and if they are small, you can reheat them immediately in a good fire, even those made out of crocum.

If the earth has hair in it, and does not crack when heated, and does not separate from the mold, the molds will not crack either and will not run when cast.  Reheat them at your leisure in a closed fire and do not expose them when warm to the air.

Dawb rather thickly in two or three layers, doing  similarly at the points of the joints, so that the silver does not run out of the mold.

Reheat in a reverberatory furnace.

To test if your earth is good, rather than putting some on your mold, dawb in that place of the wall of the forge that is around the opening and mouth of the bellows, then turn on the fire and if it tolerates this without cracking, then it is good.

Casting with gold  and silver 

To cast silver  and gold  do always put a little ground stone of borax  on the bottom of the crucible, and put your matter on it. That way the acid smoke  won't corrupt these two matters, but it is especially efficient for gold .

If you have several molds to cast, do not fill them all in one cast, because metal  would get cold. Cast one after another.

When your mold start being red inside, look at the cast, if you do not see any black spot keep the same heat, and if needed, add a few half lighted charcoals  with the help of pliers. However, put ground borax  at the bottom of the crucible, and put silver  on the top of this matter, then put your crucible into the forge, reheat your crucible which is between lighted charcoals , until it becomes red; do not blow before that. When you'll use the bellows, make continuous longitudinal moves, tug a little bit the bellows, push and pull, that way the heat will become greater. From time to time remove your crucible out of the top of the forge with the help of your warm pliers, because if your crucible is close to the tuyere silver  would cool down rather than heat up. That why it is better to put the lighted charcoals  above the tuelle, three fingers far from the wall of the forge. That way the crucible is heating much better. When your silver  starts melting, if you find that it is too acid by noticing that the lumps are cracking and bursting, take the size of a walnut of  arsenic , and twice as much of crude tartar  which is coarsely ground, that way it will heat better. Pour some of this mixture on silver  in the crucible, it will get clearer. But if you have some of that sublimate crust on the metallic matter , and which looks like grains of steel , #  put some of this matter in your melted silver .
 
Some people leave the silver to rest a little out of the heat before casting.
silver  and gold  which are melted with the above matters won't become porous.
  
For gold , you need not as much crocum  as stone alum .
 
Small molds can be reheated soon. But you should oven-dry large and small molds because dampness go out of the mold with the heat. The intense heat of charcoals  drives the heat from within outside.
  
All silver alloy  make chape and all other metals too. 
Silver  should not be peeled off when still  molten.

You will see that it will stir it and heat it intensely and soon will make it quite liquid and ready to cast, and lighten it as it should.When it is in that state, very white and polished, shiny like quicksilver, be ready to cast. To that end, have thin, diluted sand in a pot or other vessel, which will be helpful to your mixture. Make a hole in your sand, and with you pincers put your red hot mold in this sand hole. Cover immediately the opening of your mold so that no ash or dust enters in it, and then surround it with sand up to the level of the gate and the vents. This done, peel off you mold and cast you well molten silver , the size of a pea of this metallic grain, which will immediately spread your silver  all over, making it boil and cover everything. Cast as soon as you have spread this matter; that is the secret to make silver  run, because its crust heats up and lightens it up. You can cast silver  thinner than the Capital league norm , as the royal one. 

Don't forget to add first some borras  in your molten silver , even if silversmiths  do not. However, it is good to do it and I have seen it done. Then we add matter from the crust twice, and then some of the metallic thing. Keep it from   that be laid at the very end of your forge.

Si tu want to blow away the ashes that are around your mold when you hold it with your pinces, hold it upside down and blow.

When silver  is well melted you can expose and blow it with a small bellow, but not continuously like you would do for gold , to get rid of the charcoal  and fill it only with matter that make it runny.

Whitening of cast silver 

People, even German  people, commonly cast silver  of poor quality. Because this kind of alloy produces defects and crusts, some silversmiths  are eager to whiten their works, including the coarser ones. To do this they mix an equal part of tartar  and common salt  in their bullitoyre. I saw an excellent German working that way. In my presence, he casted a lizard with a teston league alloy, which had produced a dirty crust. To clean it, this German boiled it in a bullitoyre with tartar  and powdered common salt  mixed with common water  on the fire of his forge. Then he scrubbed it because he thought it was not neat enough. From this crust he burned tartar  on a piece of paper  until it was black and did not smoke anymore. Then he diluted this tartar  into the water  form the bullitoyre, and covered all his lizard  with this. Then he put the lizard  between red hot charcoals in the forge, and he blew a bit. When the lizard  became red, he removed it, let it cool, then reheated it with the bullitoyre mixture, and scrubbed it into clear water.
+ 
Note that the bullitoyre for silver  is not appropriate to use in a crucible because the tartar  evaporates. But the vessel, being made of copper , is excellent to whiten silver  and for the mixture which colors gold .

He made sure that his tartar water  would not boil over, because its strength would disappear, so when this first boiling happens, remove it from the fire and put it on again. He held this burned tartar  mixture put on low quality silver  to be a secret.

Painting metal herbs
If you are in a hurry it would be better to dilute your color with a gum  not too thick because its oil takes a long time to dry, and it runs if thinly applied, as you have to do with herbs. If you are still in a hurry, dilute your color with egg white  beaten with fig peels ; and your work will soon be dry. But do apply it thinly.

Viper color 
 
It is the most beautiful snake  to mold, because it has very beautiful scales, round and transparent. Its natural color is made from good verdigris  well ground, with good vinegar , if it is made of lead  or tin . And in the darkest parts, season this first color with a little sulfur , as you know. And if you need to lighten and whiten, like under the throat, rub these parts with a rough cloth. Because of its nature, the male ejects a kind of small lump from its backside when pressed, like a half arquebus ball, made in its genitals, and full of highly poisonous prickles.

Roses are molded with difficulty because of their petals, which are very delicate, weak, and doubled.

Do the same thing with flies , pansies, and other delicate things like capers.

Animals oven dried for a long time

Stick your animals on a slab of earth , fix them with sharp pointed iron wires, as if you wanted to mold them, then dry them into an oven as hot as when bread  has been taken out. It is the same for snakes , birds  and other animals. But they have to be promptly dried.

Note that you have to arrange them and put them into the sand as for flowers, and promptly dry them in an oven as warm as when bread  has been taken out. Leave it there one day and one night in order for them to be very dry, otherwise it would stink. However, be sure that the oven is not too hot, it should be as warm as the sun in June, otherwise the animals would cook. Once they are dry, do not soak them;  clean them with a brush or a paintbrush.

Animals casted in copper

Advice about casting
Be careful that your cast is not too thick, and do not forget to make 2 or 3 holes and notches in the conduit, when your cast is coming near the molded thing, divide it between 3 or 4 parts like fingers, and not deep. Thus the metal will run more gently, without preventing vapors and smoke.

Always make the entry of you cast close to the medal and the notch, when lumpy, it will lessens the metal's fury.

To cast a spider  on a leaf, and to prevent the sand from covering the under belly, fix a bit of melted wax  at the end of its tail, and bottom part of the body, with the help of a warm wire as you know. Once the leaf has burnt and the wax  has melted, two small holes remain on the leaf, that will be the cast of the spider .

Casting a spider on a leaf

Usually big spiders have hairy legs, which are difficult to mold if you do not lay hairs down flat, or if you don't burn them with the flame of a candle, or if you stiffen them and lay them flat by oiling  them with wheat oil . Kill them into vinegar  and urine , like snakes , or in spirits . Then arrange your them on a beautiful vine leaf, or another leaf, then you can make the undisciplined hair look like tamed hair by rubbing them with mouth glue, or something similar. Their true color is vinegar  or greenish. And season with sulphur in random places. Arrange your slab of clay  and place your vine leaf on it, your dead spider in the middle. Pierce the middle of the spider 's body with the tip of an iron  or latten  wire. Then fix diagonally some small latten  tacks all around the vine leafs in order to secure it. Then block the end of the legs with a bit of melted wax using a warm iron  wire, and smooth it out with the tip of a pair of small pincers. do the same with the other edges of the spider . Return🜊

When the wax is cool, scrape away the superfluous parts with the point of a penknife, that way the end of the legs will stay neat. Then arrange the disc of earth around the spider, and cast your soaked sand, as you did for others. In this fashion you will have to burn the vine leaf in the mold. Otherwise, you will not have to. To cast your spider  more easily, make sure the animal is dead, avoiding the entanglement of its legs while agonizing. When you have done your first cast, peel this side of the leaf, then do the second cast.

One can skin small cats  and remove their eyes and all their guts. Then place a small stick vertically between the teeth in order to open their mouths. Then with iron nails  one should attach their feet to a small board, arrange the required position. Once they are tied by their feet with small iron rings , one has to hang them upside down into the sun. By doing so, they will get the right shape and dry, the belly will tighten and the the tail will remain high up thanks to the twist that you made. Once they are already a bit dry, one may twist the head as he wishes and secure the position with any tool. One may finish to dry the animal by placing it in an oven once the bread has been taken off. Then place some realistically painted lead  balls or wax  balls in the eye-sockets. One should paint them with gummed ink  so that they look like jet. One can add a painted tongue, or horns, or wings or anything you may imagine, same goes for rats  or any animal.

Also. One cannot mold the hairy legs of big spiders  or any other hairy animal if they had not been rubbed with wheat oil  before they are laid flat. This will make the hair  firmer and will dry very quickly.  Hairy things entangle in the  sand, and do not burn very well.

Molding a crab
It is a secret and a masterpiece to mold a crab  well because it is necessary to proceed differently than you would  with other animals, because its shell is quite difficult to ...  and that is why it is necessary to reheat the mold three or four times. And on top of all that, it leaves a hard crust that is  gray like ash . It is not molded from one piece and one cast, like plants. Rather, in two casts as with serpents which are easily stripped. After it is opened, nimbly remove this crust with the very fine point of a pen-knife, not with quicksilver  which would do nothing  and likewise those small crusts of the second cast which get into the cavities that the sand  or the molded animal made because it has curved legs. Here is the subtlety and the secret of stripping it. As you molded it the crab  from the back side in the way that you did for  the others animals , remove the stomach and all the curved legs from it. Make your second cast in the way that you did for  the other animals , but as it will have set, take care that you not open the mold unless you have first reheated it well. Otherwise, because of its curved legs, you would break the whole thing. Herein lies the subtlety. If, after it has been well reheated and opened, you see that the crust is not burned enough, reheat it  until it is burned enough . 

It a crab  can be painted like a crayfish.

For opening the mold, it is not necessary to soak it because, once reheated, it will open itself by itself.

Stag beetle
Like a crab, it a stag beetle  is also difficult to burn, therefore do stag beetles  as you did crabs.

For molding thinly
After you have molded the first mold as the core, leave it to dry well before removing the figure from wax , so that the mold is not ruined. Afterwards, then make make a small lasagna of paste  as thick as you like, and, once you have greased the cavity of your first hollowed mold with butter , apply the paste  to it the cavity of the first concave mold  and then the upper part of the second mold. If you grease the mold  with oil , it will be soaked up into the mold  and it will not be as clean as butter .

Wax representations made from white lead  and cerussite  are not made to be burned and melted in a mold where you want to cast silver  and gold ; this would make it brittle.

Melted sulphur  falls down to the bottom of your mold, but lets the wax  keeps some of its quality, melting it but leaving it a little firm. You can thus melt your wax  representation on fire. If your wax is composed of cerussite  or something similar, you need to put your mold into boiling water.

You don't need all this to mold flat representations made of wax , because the wax  can be removed completely from the mold, and won't remain inside it.

When lead  or tin  casts fill with bubbles
 
If your casted work became porous, it can be repaired with very firm wax, and you can gild  or silver it afterwards. If you cast fine, the alloy of one ℥ of lead  to one lb of tin is good. But if you cast with lead ligue     , indeed you need one lb of lead  to two ℥ of tin, because lead is fat and sticky, goes over the alloy. I have cast a very small lizard that way. If you cast something thick, which keep the heat for a long time, it will make bubble if there is not enough tin . Your mold should not be cold, but cool enough that you can hold it without burning your hand, or that you can hold your finger into the cast without burning yourself. Your tin  or lead  must be like red. Cast your lead first, then cast tin. When you are going to cast, add a piece of resin  to your mixture, then a little looking-glass tin . If you add too much lead  to your tin , the mixture wouldn't be fluid enough. To know the right proportion , If tin  cries loudly, it means that there is not too much lead ; if tin  cries softly, it means that you added too much lead . Be wary

You can solder with the same matter, then rework it and remove away all the unwanted thick parts  with a burin.
Tin  is a metal that can… , makes bubbles and burn, and more capricious to work with than gold  and silver .
Lead  must not be only red, it must be quick, and as liquid as water, which is a sign of its perfect heat. Your mold must be so hot that you couldn't bear to put your finger into it. Do not open your mold until is has cooled down. Just as for silver  and gold , it is a sign of good casting when lead  comes out through the vent holes.

 not to heat your mold too hot because it makes it brittle, it makes bubbles and shrinks tin , and would also break the molded thing. Do not dip you hot mold into water because tin  and lead  would shrink.

Mold made from two casts
It opens once anealed. To clean it after, fix the clamps again, lute the mold, particularly the joints. Then let the earth slowly dry. When it doesn't smoke anymore, let the mold cool down until you can hold it without burning your skin. Then put your molds into the presses, or into a pot filled with sand, and cast with tin . If you cast gold  or silver  your mold needs to be cast twice, and cast when your mold becomes red-hot.

If your heated mold … , shrinks because of the bad quality of the plaster , open it after the first heating, tighten it, the lute it and clamp it again.

How to anneal the molds
Light your charcoals  from the forge, then place them in a line in a corner of the forge according to the size of your mold, in order that it be surrounded with 3 or 4 fingers of charcoals , particularly at the bottom of the mole, where it is thicker. Then put your molds on these charcoals  -- and not on a grate as some people do -- because they would get too strong a heat. Let your furnace heat up gradually for a while, always adding burning charcoal . As long as the mold is humid, your charcoal will be dampened at the bottom, but when it is dry, the charcoals start to blaze. When one side of the mold is dry, turn over; when both sides are dry and don't smoke anymore, increase the heat and cover your mold with burning coals. When the mold starts being red, do not blow on it with small bellows, because the mold would burst. Similarly, when your mold becomes red-hot, keep it well covered with burning charcoals and do not uncover it because it would crack. Prevent the draft from a window from reaching it. Then let it cool down.

When you want to anneal your molds, luted or not, do mark the belly of your mold, in order to place that side at the bottom, against the burning charcoals, because if the intensity of the heat made the mold crack, it would be better that it do so on the bottom part instead of the top part.

If your mold is small, do not heat it as long, otherwise it would crack and be damaged.

 dry by itself. When your mold starts to redden, it will soon be become completely red-hot. But make sure that its bottom is red-hot too, without any black spot.

 Common quarry sand 
In a frame, If you cast it hot, sand  will bubble; thus you have to just dry it.

I have tried to prevent molds blended with sand  from cracking when annealed, and thus not get any with flaws that crack.

Crocum ferry 
After I processed it with vinegar  and reddened under heat, I had it ground very finely on the porphyry , until there could be no ruggedness felt under the nails. Then I soaked it in very good vinegar  for 2 or 3 days, stirring the mixture several times a day. Then I boiled it and made it red-hot in a pot, and put the whole thing into an air furnace. I obtained a mass full of eyes, but that crumbled finely between the fingers. I mixed half as much as stone alum  in the sand. I diluted the sand very thinly, and molded a very small lizard, which molded very cleanly and finely. Crocum ferry  does not make the mold harder, but makes it firmer. When your mold is soft and fat under your nail, it means that the crocum  is good, very fine and well prepared. You can add any quantity of crocum , your mold will not be damaged because it is a friend of gold. I think it would be the same with silver . And in order that molds made with it do not crack, make it with needle filings.
Sand  is better made with distilled vinegar .

You can add this sand  to the molds you want to use to cast silver , because it make molds firmer, and when you scratch it, you will find it a bit rougher than the other molds not made from this sand . You mold very clean with this sand .

You can use this one for all molds, because it prevents them from cracking and bursting when heated. This sand  withstands several casts for molding flat medals. Sand from steel  or needle filings  is redder and better.

Gilding animals casted with silver 
You can gild them with an amalgam, the lines won't be damaged if they are made from silver .

Hard wax  to imprint seals
One makes these seals  out of white wax  which is harder than the other and one mixes in it some cerussite  or leaded white  very finely ground such that it is as hard as you like and mix in a drop of turpentine  to bind it. Afterwards mix it in the color that you want. It is in wax  that serves goldsmiths  for modeling.

Casting the feet of small lizards  in gold  and silver 
Because the feet of these lizards   that are very small are also  very fine, once you have molded the top and you have uncover the vents and underneath the feet are  covered lightly with wax , and then cast a second mold. And the wax  that one removes, it leaves a little cast for these said feet, and again such that the underneath part  comes out in one piece that you can repair well, And the scales on top of the toes come out  well.

Around the big lizard  nails, put on each a small round of wax  to make the cast like this.
 
Marks made by  the pin  points of iron  thread which one finds on the head of an animal
With the points or pins  with which you have dressed your animal  all over, do same with the head, but out of  the head which is pierced, a certain moisture seeps out around the wound and this little exudation prevents the sand from covering the point well and there always remain little pinpricks. But to avoid this, you can plant in the plaster  of the said blunt pin point and around the upper part of the point, and over this point, there put a little hard wax  or a little mastic  or cement . And by the medium of the hot thread of iron  there you can hold the throat of the animal which one removes the iron   when you come to uncover the vents and the throat for doing the second cast.

Clamps and the broken mold
When you have done the first firing and taken off the clamps and you have opened your mold to clean it by taking off the bubbles with quicksilver  which one cannot do with closed molds, reclose the mold and reattach the clamps but not in the same place as the first time. Reapply lute and dry it but if this is for casting silver  or gold use  lute with the rest of sand which has been used because this is the best netting. If your mold is broken in refiring you can augment it with clamps and lute.

 Porosity and little holes which are in the mold

It oftens happens when you cast two or three molds one after the other using the same dish, because the last casting comes from the bottom of the dish and is thicker, and then often the last cast which comes from the bottom and which is the thickest of the dish, may easily become porous. Cast thinner and neater, as long as you blow very strongly on the soaked sand while casting in order to clear the little air bubbles.

When the sand is casted thick, it often becomes porous


Thing that cannot be released from the mold

You must cut it inside the mold in order to burn it. Cut it with scissors at once, that way blood  doesn't flow on the mold, and doesn't make dirty. Because this dirt would be removed with difficulty when reheated. Then place your mold into a furnace, or  something similar, in order to quickly dry the mold which must be removed before the forming of crusts or molds.@

When you mold small lizards , and when you want to peel away the first molded part, start to peel away the heads, you will know its place thanks to the needle.
Don't peel away the legs before peeling away the entire body, to avoid that the naked body, moving,doesn't remove the legs from their place, which would not be easy to put back into place. When you remove the small needles fixing the legs, block the legs or press the legs with something, that way while removing the needles the legs won't move; finally, you can fix the legs again with wax .

Various animals entwined

You can entwine a snake  with a lizard , each one biting the other, or a snake  eating a frog , or a wall lizard  or something similar. But since these interlacings cannot be stripped, cut what's possible, and allow the rest to burn. To make the mouth of the snake , which must stand high, hold a wall lizard , which is small and would need to be held in the air, because the snake 's head is higher, put under the wall lizard  a mound of earth suitable to support it.  And if you place the mold in a furnace, the animal drying quickly, it will quickly shrink, then it will burn more easily. These interlacings are also made to mask wounds or defects on the animal which happen when we catch them. Do not forget to join with wax , applied carefully with a hot iron  wire, all the parts of the animal which are one on top of the other, or those which are not well pressed on the slab of clay, so that the soaked sand does not remove them. Do that in order to

avoid putting pins that should not be put, only on the top of the head, the thickest parts of the body, and on the delicate parts like the middle of the lizard 's feet, the nails of which you will drive into the clay , thus they won't move. Once your first mold is casted, peel away the belly of the animal, but do not forget to put some tenuous little pieces of wax  at the tip of the lizard 's feet. But if it is from a wall lizard , lightly cover all the sole of its feet with wax , which will be removed with the second cast. A cavity is left which will be fill these little fingers with metal. then rework it. Make  sure that wax is fixed well on the parts of the animal which are one on top of the other, so that the soaked sand which comes in does not make them move. If that happened your jacket of clay  would be spoiled and your mold wouldn't get the right thickness, would have holes, and would be spoiled. To obviate that you can make a thicker mold. If this occurs you could rework it in this fashion.

To repair a pierced mold
        
If the molded animal pulls of in certain places, moves from the place you had fixed it, or has not completely died, or if you didn't fix it well with the iron  pins or with the melted wax , or if the animal hasn't the right thickness on the outside at the relief, or if it is pierced, instead of removing the animal from the mold, peel away the weak parts, or the pierced part, and make holes all around these parts, then dip the back side of the mold, quickly cast onto this place with the same soaked sand which will go into the holes, the cast will adhere to the first cast. But you will have to lute this spot afterwards.

Sand made of crocum ferri  
        
You can use the mixture made of crocum ferri  to cast silver  or gold , this mixture will make these casts firm, and prevent these from cracking and making burrs. And I believe that for flat things, it would withstand severa casts. Which however is not commonly done for gold  and silver .

To make gold  fluid 

Put as much verdigris  as sal ammoniac , as much borax  as saltpeter . But don't add a greater quantity of borax  and saltpeter  than half the quantity of verdegris  and sal ammoniac , in fact add as much borax  and saltpetre  all together as verdigris . Grind into powder the ingredients on the marble  slab, then grind again with very good vinegar  until it is very fine, like a ground color, grind verdigris  with oil , then leave to dry if you have time, if you haven't so much time dry it with the fire of the forge, make so that it is very dry.

One of the principal things for casting is to cast very hot, especially large metals


Casting big works with gold 

Not only should one clamp the mold very well, but also strengthen it with good iron wire links or adequate straps.

Before casting with gold, clean thoroughly your forge with lead  and tin .

Secret for soldering small works made of gold  and silver 

If some little pieces of legs cannot be easily removed from gold  or silver  casting, it is because you didn't cast wax  under these parts. Beat some soldering gold  very finely, then cut it into very fine flakes, cut the quantity you need. Take some of this phlegm or white and thick saliva  which is on the teeth, put some of this matter to the place you want to solder with the point of a burin, then place your flakes, then put to the opposite part a mixture made of a small quantity of soaked fat earth and saliva , thanks to the mixture the solder will better adhere. Then pulverize a bit of borax  on it, and heat up Quince pulp seed water  to a boil and others too.

Colors for gold , or sauce

Take as much verdigris  as sal ammoniac , & saltpetre  the size of a bean. Because if you put in too much, it would make the whole thing boil so much that it would all pour out. Saltpeter  is only put in to make it boil, so that you know when the material has boiled enough. This color put on sour melted gold  makes it soft instantly.
Softening gold  
Casting

It must be lengthened out with respect to the thing you have molded. And at a minimum for large molds it must be four or five fingers in length. You can make it large enough for half the mold & then divide it in three points of such a sort, and so the molded things will each  be small. But your points must be small. And in the middle of the casting & of its points, make some holes to impede the fury of the metal  & make it run more softly. It is also necessary to fix the bent parts of the animal with little notched lines, and similarly the end of the tail and other fine parts so that the metal  goes throughout & flows from one part to the other.

Do not forget to make a wax cast of the paws of   & things as subtle as this.

When you have molded an animal in the first part of the mold, do not let this part dry out before you have removed the said animal, because when the mold dries out it will shrink and it will also make the animal shrink. Keep it therefore in a damp & humid place until you have done it.
 
Vine leaf  and small frog 

To mold, take vine leaves  as they are blooming, just as with all herbs  & flowers , or a young vine  regrowing after it has been cut or when the leaves come off in autumn, because new leaves  are knottier & have more evident veins. By contrast, old leaves  are smooth all the way through & full of holes in many places. Place therefore your leaf , its back behind it against the clay plaster , and fasten it with little pins. Leave it nevertheless with its natural curling. And make a notch in the clay to hide the stem for the first cast.  And when it's done and dry, take out the stem of the leaf  and clean it well with your jacket and press it with a little scoop of clay. Afterwards, make many castings around the leaf  with wax , as you know well, & make a slender casting & with many lines & knots.

Vine leaf  is painted with a green made of scudegrun  & verd de terre .

You can cast a spider or frog & whatever you like on the leaf.

Casting gold 
Take a crusol that can contain a certain amount, as you wish to place roughly crushed borax  into it. Place the borax   at the bottom and then the gold  on top of it. Arrange the coal  in the forge in such a way that the wind of the bellow will blow above the crusol and no on its side as it would cool it down and would not heat it enough. Also, make sure it is three good fingers   away from the wall of the forge so that it is quite surrounded by coal . Allow the crusol to anneal until it is quite red. Then, have your boy strongly blow the bellow with long pushes, as in this manner it heats it better. Meanwhile, once the gold  will be melted, blow a small bellow above it. Because otherwise  the gold  would turn sour and would acquire some kind of coat. As long as there will be some swirling smoke as you blow this way, it means that it is not soft enough for the cast. Therefore, uncover the melting pot and without displacing it and without stopping the bellow, tilt it towards you so you may well see what is inside. Throw a ferue of borax  in it and blow wind towards it with the small bellow in a jerky fashion. Should there be coal  inside, blow a bit stronger to make them come out. And if the gold  still smokes and swirls, add borax  again and blow above it. Beware that it is still sour and not soft enough, it will show a coat when you blow it as if it had cooled down. By contrast, if it does not show this sign, it is soft enough. Then, blow strongly so that it the gold   is quite heated and once you think it is hot enough, throw colour on top of it in the crusol and the colour should be composed as following: verdigris , saltpeter , sal ammoniac , and a bit of borax . And continue blowing with the small bellows, and the gold  will turn shiny like

If you cast in gold  some piece of important dimensions , lute your mold with the same sand  or put crocum  on it.

If you wish to cast some large work, or of important dimensions , create at the bottom or at an extremity of the forge a  vented furnace where you may hold your mold in the sand  so red.

One may cast two or three pounds of gold .
 
 136r
 FROM PREVIOUS PAGE: And continue blowing with the small bellows, and the gold  will turn shiny like  a mirror. And once you will want to start  casting, put a bit more colour in and let it rest a little, still blowing wind with both the small and the large bellows. Finally, place your mold quite red between the small molds or in a crusol full of sand  quite hot and start  casting. And once it will have stuck, you may, if you wish, throw it into water  as gold  does not get damaged like tin  which breaks.
To melt gold  bullion, there is no need to blow above the crusol  with the small bellow.
For large works, the crusol made of sand  has to be placed in a wind oven so that it is all red at the end of the furnace.
Gold , when exposed to wind or when forged becomes black. But a bit of aqua forte  removes the black  instantly.
If you have to forge a work made of gold  on brass , as is done on small statues, put a lead  sheet between the gold  and the brass , and rather than anneal it and put it back in the fire, dip it in the aqua forte  and it will be soft.
It is enough for the cast to be of the same thickness as the medal, that it from the middle of the cast, up to the medal. But if the medal is very thick, one should not thicken the cast as a result, because a thick cast never comes out well. It may be done large to embrace the medal as much as possible.

latten  casting

Take latten  from skillet pans, used to make baby's cereal, which is doulx and apt for the cast. Some people say that counter from Germany  contain a lot of calamine . However, when they are tempered, calamine  evaporates, calamine  mixed with melted latten  always evaporates, because latten  becomes red again, thanks to the reiteration of melting. However, fresh calamine  and only fresh calamine , which is blended with remelted latten , makes latten  run, and allow a clean cast. Because calamine  which is added to remelted latten  is half-damaged compared with its natural state. This half-damaged calamine  make latten  porous and agitated because it has a tendency to evaporate. Thus add only very fresh calamine  to melted latten . Make sure to cast your mold very hot, you mold must become red-hot, like molds to cast gold , silver , copper  and metal. If you pour fresh calamine , avoid its smoke which is pernicious. To cast a medal, I took thirty counters from Germany  and xii clous de rosette  made of doulx latton , like for claires medals which are made of soft latten . This matter contains a lot of calamine like all kind of yellow latten , and make a lot of smoke which prevent latten  from running, and make it porous, that is why it is necessary to make many vents and to cast very hot, latten  must be as white as water , or as melted silver  or as a polished mirror of steel . The second fusion will come out much better because evaporated calamine  does not make as much smoke. If you use a molding frame that does not break and holds its own, the second casting  will come more neatly out of the mold, because the frame is impregnated with the smoke of calamine . If you add sal ammoniac  to your latten , this latten  will be clear and shiny, but will be even more shiny with huile tingente . Do not use another sand than the above mentioned to mold a noyau, and the mold must become red-hot, like a mold to cast gold . Make a lot of vents. If you cast yellow latten with the prepared tutty you will not get any smoke.

This metal is capricious to cast because of the smoke of the calamine . Do not leave it out of the fire, as some do with silver . Because when air or wind touch it, the mold gets cold at once. When you cast it, this metal always leaves burrs, like when casting glass . Foundry workers  do not usually use this very yellow latten  as much because of the calamine  which is heated. They cast red copper  and turn it yellow with fresh calamine , or with some prepared tutty. Before casting, clean it with charcoal  with a quere made of copper  or iron . Then cover it with a cloth soaked in lard  blended with saltpeter , or sal ammoniac , in order to protect it from wind, which would cool it down.

Casting red copper 
Pure cauldron red copper , or copper  of any other small works, is good to cast. To make it runny, add some sal ammoniac  to it, and when you are about to cast, add a little bit of fine tin . One must cast the copper  very hot into the mold, so that it is burning and very red, like gold , silver , latten , and metal . You will know that it is hot enough when it is clear and shining like a newly polished steel mirror , or like melted silver . Protect it from wind so that it doesn't cool down too soon. Cover your cast with tow in order to prevent it from cooling down. Red copper  is cleaner than latten , which smokes a lot, which prevents the metal from running. I have moulded it as a noyau very neatly, and as thin as a piece of paper . It must be very hot, white and shining like melted silver , or a mirror. I have moulded it as a noyau with the same sand  mentioned above.

It takes more time to melt copper  and latten  than any other metals, even red copper . It will run and will comes out well if you cast it very hot, and as thin as water .

Remove your mold from the fire, and set it into embers, which should fill a pot or vessel.

Huile tingente  to make metal runny
Take some mercury , some real sublimate of Venice , and not sublimate of arsenic , aes ustum  a poix, sal ammoniac , a poix. Ground everything separately, then blend them together in a glass  bottle, and put it on warm ashes. You will see that everything melts like wax , and will have bright colors. Leave to set, add a small quantity of this mixture on every metal, it will run marvelously.
Foundry workers  who make large casts to mold statues, clean the dirt from these molds with calamine , and a lot of sal ammoniac  in order to make moulds clear and neat. When they want to cast they add a lot of tin . Dampness and cold could spoil their works, that is the reason why even a small source of water  in the hole can damage the whole thing.

Clamps
To make clamps use flat tongs made from wire, which is reheated and bent, and  hammered on anvil. Since those clamps are thinner, they burn more easily, being used in reheated molds. So use new clamps.

Wetting sand  to mold flat medals
Flat medals, made of wax  or metal , must be oiled very lightly and then touched with a brush of spirits .  So that the already moistened mold takes well the oiled thing without rejecting it, one warms the water well in order to wet the sand , because with cold water it would be rejected.  It is necessary to oil  medals, because they do not expand and in this way would break the mold. Animals, which expand, do not need oiling. The hot water much be of such a heat that you cannot keep your figure in it without it becoming too warm. Wet the thickest sand  for flat and solid medals rather than for  lizards and finer things. Once your sand has set, clean and scrape your mold on one side and the other, and on the bottom edge of the thrown side of the medal, make a notch so that it is easier to take out.  Lower the mold, scraping what surrounds the medal, so that on all sides you can take it out easily without it damaging the mold.  Then make some gashes around the first mold used to throw so that the second time that you throw in it, it will be identical to the first one, and in the same way, make a notch at the bottom of the mold, where the held of the item cast lies. Also make some gashes  in the sides of the cast. This done, wet the back of the first mold in oiled water , and after the second casting moisten it with warm water  if you have molded your medal in a noyau mold.  Having done the first cast, and this one having set, cut around the edge of the medal with the point of a knife so that it comes out of the throw and is not buried in it.  Then having made the second cast, and having opened your mold, take away the medal in one go, with two knife points, one on the side of the cast object and one on the side of the head, which is at the opposite end.

Take care not to oil your medal too much because if the seeps out, it prevents the sand  from serving its purpose and coming together and renders it wavy and lumpy. You must only touch the middle of the medal with the tip of your oil brush and then smear the oil  everywhere.


Make especially sure that the throw is as wide as you can on the medal and holds it together well. The gate of your cast must always be big and always narrowing as you go towards the medal. Also do not forget to notch the gate of your cast.

 If you want to cast gold , silver , copper  or brass , it is necessary that they be perfectly red, and fired on the inside when you cast, and perfectly reheated twice, if there is something inside to be burnt and cleaned.
The molds of animals that you burn must be reheated in such a manner that the animal burns up.  But if it has big bones, it is frustrating to take out and ☿   often breaks delicate things because of its heaviness. One does not put ☿  in molds that can open.  It is often molds for flowers that do not open because they are cast in one go.
When you want to reheat your molds, fix cramp-irons on the joints, so that when they reheat they will not bend, contract or break. This is done once the cast is made.
The scrapings of the mold can also be used instead of bricks  after being reheated, and also the leftover bits of the mold that have already been used. You can also pat it over important things, like works in gold  or silver . You can also reheat it and blend it with water diluted with sal ammoniac , like spar  from Germany, and is excellent sand  for box molds for all metals.
The molds with things that need to be burnt out inside them, those ones will not open until the thing that is inside is burnt, like the molds for crayfish, crab, great-horned beetles. Do not open the molds in which you will burn something, not before the thing is burnt, it could be crayfishes, crabs, stag beetles, pictures, and pieces of wax and black sulphur , which do not come out of the mold easily .
You must not mold on brick  or wood  because they absorb and attract water too early, and do not allow the sand to set. The best place for the sand  is on a fresh layers of clay .  And yet, I have experienced that grey earth  dries out the mold too quickly. Yellow earth   is better.

For medals, and flat things, the sand  must be quite thick and moistened so that it sets quickly. And when the sand  is thusly thick, you can shake and move the table where you mold lies, so that the movement  makes the sand  go everywhere. But when the sand  is clear, as for flowers and herbs, you cannot shake it, nor can you do it when there is something attached to wax  or other things which are prone to come off, such as the legs of crayfish or other similar things. And if by chance your sand  is too thick, you must quickly add some water. And having put the sand  in the water, examine it until it is thick on the bottom and clear on top.  The clearest is thrown in immediately and then bubbles and the thickest is thrown in at the end so that it strengthens the mold.

Talcum  mixed with the molds
I used the one from which I had extracted the oil . I crushed it very finely even more into a steel  mortar with a pestle which was  rough like a file. I crushed it very finely into a cottony, downy powder. I mixed it with the sand  and soaked both matters together, and I casted it en noyau. It molded very clean and there is no doubt that it will withstand fire.

Gold  casted very thinly
When goldsmiths have to solder something quickly but don't have enough time to forge it, they melt gold  and then they pour it on a cloth or on anything else that withstands fire. Then they flatten it swiftly with a hammer or another similar tool, and it the gold  is very tenuous and it even retains the impression of the cloth.
Unalloyed pure gold  can be cast into a medal but not into herbs and lizards or other very delicate things if it is not alloyed.
A pansy  which is oiled  with wheat oil  can be cast with alloyed gold .
And other fruit leaves , but with branches  that are not large and especially the leaves, once cast, can be soldered.

Imitation diamonds set into the work 
Spread a fine layer of imprinting black wax on the inside of the  frame then coat it inside with wheat oil , then dust it with lamp smoke  because this color should not be lustrous for fake stones. Having done this, set your stone with a piece of wax then, with a steel point, or a small finishing hammer, join the edge of the frame with the stone, so that light cannot get in but be careful not to hit the stone, which would break.

Casting with lead  and tin 
When you melt this often, it becomes sour and fragile because it has to be cast very hot and it makes it half-calicanated.  Use new stuff. 
The way I have done it for lizards and serpents is with two ℥ of pure tin  for one lb. of unrefined lead  that is impure. The mold is made out of the aforementioned sand , common for all metals, when it is reheated, leave it to cool until you can put your finger in it without causing a breach in the gate of the cast. As for the lead , it is melted in a crucible with a bellows' fire until both the crucible and the lead  are red.  When it gets to that state, cleanse it anew with charcoal  or with a specially made scraper or with the pufts of the little bellows. This done, leave it to rest in it red state and you can even reheat it, then if you want, throw in a bit of resin  to burn away the filth.  However, some think it best not to put any in because it leaves filth.  But when they are ready to cast, they cannot forget to also thrown in a bean-size quantity of bismuth  for each pound of lead . And it must be as red as the melted metal when it enters the mold.  If the mold is large, it is much better to put in in a press so that they join well and so that the lead  does not come out of the mold.  However, should this happen, and that for the first, second or third time your mold does not fill up, cast heartily because for as long as your metal is red it will mix and join with the other one and will come out very neatly like the main one.  The same thing can be said for pure tin  used for thin things.  And that way for doing pure tin  is one ℥  of new lead  for one lb. of the former.  Large molds must be put in a press held tightly between two layers of copper , and then bury the whole thing in sand,  which is better than ashes , because being heavy, it will seal better.  Otherwise large molds are prone to open because the metal is heavy.  Some make square molds

When the metal is thick, you do not need to cast as hot as when it is thin.

Note that If you want to cast with cuttlefish bone , they cannot be too warm because that would burn the cuttefish . For this effect, try paper. It it becomes brown, it is enough, and it is good for casting, but if it blackens the paper, then it is too hot.

If you want to cast paper with writing on it, make a mixture with half lead  and half tin . As soon as it is melted, throw it between two pieces of cardboard  on a flat place that is level. And with a point or gold  or hard wood , engrave on the left the writing that you want. And having poured the lead onto the cardboard,  press onto it the other piece of cardboard .

Casting wax  to mold an animal that one has not got
Take some white wax  which is much more appropriate for this kind of work than anything else, because it is much firmer and does not leave as much filth, as much as you need to cast the animal that you propose, and no more. And take  a half quantity of ground coal  and neatly sieved through a cloth or coal sleeve, using it to give some color to your wax , that would otherwise be transparent and you will not be able to see your lines as clearly.  Put your wax  on the coal fire to melt. And when it is well-melted and well-liquified, have, for a full eared-porringer of melted wax, as much sulphur  as a large walnut.  Pulverize it.  Melt it over a slow fire and when it is melted, do not leave it on the fire because it will become too hard. But take it off and keep stirring it with a little stick and when it has finished bubbling and is as liquified as water, cast it into the wax  that you will have previously removed from the fire.  And mix and stir both of the them so that they join together.  After stir in little by little while continuously mixing, the charcoal  that has been repeatedly ground, and in this way it will be very well incorporated.  This is how you will know that your wax  has gone beyond its ideal heating point, it will release no more smoke, it will start to have lines appearing on the side and not in the middle, and those lines will be close to each other.  If you cast too hot, you will not be able to separate your wax from your mold and it would stick to the cast.  When it is at the right state, stir it with a little stick so that the pulverized charcoal  is well mixed in and has not fallen to the bottom of the mixture.  And in this way, throw it in  your mold bit by bit and not in one go, because wax  is not runny 

This black sulphured wax  is for fashioning round figures that do not come out of the mold. And they need to be burned in the moule au noyau rather than be opened like the ones that have something jutting out or an intertwining of legs and arms. And this wax , thanks to the sulphur,  melts with little heat and leaves without leaving any filth.  If by some misfortune the crushed charcoal  remains in ashes, when you open the mold and blow on it, it will come clean.

To make wax serpents or other things to affix to candles, it is necessary to cast them with esbaucher wax  of all colors.

 not like other things. And for this one, you can cast two or three times until your mold is full. Now, concerning this mold of pulverized white plaster  & reheated in the manner of the sand  from the preceding recipes, you should have made it long ago because it is used many times. But, before using it, soak it for a good hour in cold water , & at a minimum, at least as long in hot water  that at first is so hot that you can't hold your finger in it. And note that it absorbs no more, but that it appears very wet overall without water seeping into it. In removing it closed from the hot water , cast your wax  in such a state of heat as has been described. And neither the first nor the second casting will readily come out well, hardly, until the mold is soaked. Let it cool down before opening it so that the cast thing not break. You will know that the casting is good when the wax  coming back out of the mold is thin and even. Remember to make several castings along the whole length of the mold so that in this way the wax  runs better.
Make the first 
  casting twice as large as other molds. And if, in the first casting, your work fills with bubbles and in so doing does not come out neatly, it's all the same, because you have to face the fact that the three or four first do not readily come out well. Firstly, you will know whether there are a few barbs that keep it from stripping well. And you will remove them if, on their own, they do not remove themselves in the two or three first castings. And the more that you cast, the more you will do it neatly. And your mold will serve you more than one hundred times if it Is well governed. But it is good to soak it one night or one day before casting so that it be well soaked. The same must be done for fruits made from sugar. This wax  is very soft & friendly & pliant, like copper. And if it is hard this is  because of sulfur , which makes it melt more easily than than other wax , so much that you can see evidence on a hot slate. And the sulfur  that you put inside will be found the second time that you melt it, as  cracks on the bottom. Having in this way passed through wax , it will not catch fire at all when put to a candle. And in this case, I believe that it will cast quite the medal  . One uses the same wax  in place of varnish  to  .

When your animal is cast, cut away the froth & superfluous things with a hot pen knife. And if you want, plait and wrap it around some stick or candle, put it in some hot water  to soften and hold it in turning it around.

Lower the protrusions of the castings so that they be even & that the wax  has more silver so that it can run all in one go without turning through the windings of the snake.

To cast in sulfur 

To cast neatly in sulfur , arrange the pith of bread  under the brazier, as you know. Mold whatever you want into it & let it dry & you will have very neat work.


Try sulfur  passed through melted wax , because it will no longer ignite & and make eyelets.

Molding and shrinking a large shape

Mold it with the pith of bread just out of the oven, or like that aforementioned, & in drying out it will shrink & consequently so will the medal that you will cast. By these means - lengthening out or enlarging the imprinted bread - you can vary the shape & from one face  make several different ones. The bread  straight from the oven is best. And the one which has been heated twice contracts more. You can cast sulfur  without letting the imprint on the bread  dry, if you want to cast it as large as it is. But, if you want to let it shrink, let it dry to a greater or lesser extent.

Casting of lead  and tin  in plaster 

If you want to cast any flat medal or any animal that is not very heavy, and that must not be burnt inside the mold, you can indeed cast in mixed  plaster  & brique , as above; and not in plaster  alone, because it contracts too much feeling an ardent fire if it is not so mixed. But, with the brick , it holds well. However, take heed to dry out your mold at length & on a slow fire & with patience, because there is no need to reheat it. But when your work is of flowers  or other things that want their mold to be reheated & set ablaze, mix the plaster with stone alum  & even with crocum . I have molded in very neat plaster  & brick  & it has sustained several castings.


I tried both plaster  & brick  alone and molded en noyau  with like the others. My mold was very clean, having lightly oiled  & rubbed my medal with spirits . I made my casting wide at the entrance, narrowing it as it goes along until it reaches the medal which is very thin. I notched the casting which embraced the medal well. I dried the mold out well on a slow fire & finally, I heated it well without turning it red. I let it cool in such a way that I could hold my finger to it without burning myself. I made a line of 4 ℥ of tin , & ix deniers of lead . I cast it red, and it was quite good and beautiful. Afterwards I put xii deniers of lead on top of 4 ℥ of tin . It is very good & beautiful.


When there is nothing to burn in the mold, it is not necessary to reheat it for lead  and tin . But for flowers  and other things that must be burned, it is.

Casting a crayfish 
Thecrayfish  is one of the most fantastical to cast, but also provides an example for casting other difficult things. You can distinguish males and female by the eggs that the females carry, and by the four little white back legs that males have in their tails after behind main eight legs. It is good to dry them out a bit so that the bumps come out more hard and beautiful, because none of what is made of shell shrinks.  It is true that should you dry the little inside legs for too long, they become diminished and have no body.  If they are too dry, the flesh separates from the scales.  Be sure then to maintain the mean.  They have certain hairs between the legs and at the end of the tail.  And because all hair is difficult to cast, because it gets mixed up in the sand and does not release, you can burn it by putting  a hot iron on the crayfish  so that it the hair  cannot be seen.  As for animals that have hair or feathers, you must grease the hair with wheat oil , which is very dry and which will make the hair lay flat and straight.  In this way, you will have form of your animal and you will have the hair.  Should it the hair  be wavy, it can be repaired. If your crayfish  has eggs, which are delicate, and which will be difficult to take out of the mold without breaking, you would do better to make the first cast  with the crayfish  on its belly and eggs. In this way, you will open the mold with it the crayfish  on its back, which will be hard and easy to manipulate.  And the belly and the eggs will remain in the mold. And rather than opening your mold for the second time, you will have to burn it with them in it. This way, it will open easily, and what has been burned will come away cleanly. In this way, the second casting, which is done on the first one that has successfully taken hold, separates easily from the first, after having been refired. This is a singular secret for similar moldings.
The casting is made by the very thin tail.
If some little thing is missing, you can reattach it or else fill it with goldsmith 's cement .
Do not forget to rub with spirits  before you mold.
Stag beetles , crayfish  and crabs  are molded in the same way.
If your crayfish  has no eggs, mold the back on top and the belly on the bottom. You can give it some.
It the crayfish  can be molded hollow for the body, but not for the legs. And for a good result, take note that  the crayfish  is rather fantastical to mold hollow, this ought to be reserved for turtles .
When you open your mold, you will find the crayfish  has white bones, but they will not be powder. And without opening it, the mercury  will not have affected the process.
Apply very light oil colors.
To paint it, boil it with wine  and a bit of salt  so that they become very red and use this as a model.  Paint the back with vermillion  mixed with laquer , and the sides and the underside of the belly and the legs with vermillion  and yellow ochre  and white .

 Let your crayfish  dry a little in the sun, by itself. If it has spawns, they will shrink while drying, and be all the more beautiful for it. Make your paste out of yellow potter 's earth , just like for the other representations.  Lay your crayfish  on it, the back side down, and the other parts which are more tricky to mold -- legs, belly, eggs - side up. Drive in the back side in the clay  paste up to the legs, which is about the half part of the crayfish's body . Fix the body with a pointy iron  thread in the middle and, if you feel you need it, you can also drive another one at the edge of the tail.  And in order that the big legs be lower than the head, which is lower because it is linked from below, add a little clay under the head . Then add a bit of clay  under the jacket in order to raise it. Hide the feelers under the clay  and under the crusher claws, then arrange it as you like. Stretch out the walking legs to the joints, and for the first cast, bend the second part of the walking legs. Fix the joints of the legs with wax  and a warm wire  so they will not move. If you want to mould something fancier, fix the end of one walking legs on the body or on a crusher claw , using the same wax . If the female has spawns, bent half the tail over the spawns, and keep the shape by fixing the tail with a wire . Be sure that you will be able to clean this part. Finally rub your crayfish  with spirits , and cast your sand. Once the sand is hardened, uncover the back side, the head, the eyes, and the small legs close to the crusher claws, and the walking legs all along. One must uncover these parts as much as possible. Then bend and cover the spawns again. The other animals
Fix what may raise the two padded edges on each side of the mouth  with melted wax  under them.
 Uncover as many parts as possible, but be sure the channels you make are well stripped.
Incline your mould to the thickest side of the animal.
To paint the crayfish, one paints the middle of the back with vermilion ,  mixed with a bit of lacquer . The sides, the belly, and below the legs with a mixture made of vermilion , ceruse , and a bit of yellow ochre . As with all things, always keep the real one in front of you in order to copy it as realistically as possible .
Lay the feelers on the crusher claws, or solder this part with a wire made of bleached brass .
When you arrange the legs, be sure that they do not get over the belly, and that they are well set against the belly otherwise

 are not so uncovered. But since crayfish  are troublesome to burn & clean, you have to uncover them as much as you can, even the little legs just until the tips, because they are troublesome & if, in order to not alter them, you have to take them out, you could break something of the mold. Having uncovered it with the point of a knife, like an engraving stick or another fitting thing, clean off the sand at the joints & elsewhere with your little brush really very scrupulously. And if something is loosed from the crayfish , attach it with wax , as is discussed. And also attach the horns this way. And also do the casting the length of the extremes of the little legs with wax . And refill the holes that have been made with the needles of iron  wire with it. And everything being quite clean & having uncovered more than half of it, oil  your mold after having soaked the back side in water , & do not forget to oil  all the fine parts that are between the legs and the little beaks; then rub the crayfish  with spirits . And do your second casting after having made the first mold even, so that the cramp-irons join better. Your mold must be larger on the side with the impression than on the back. Do not open your mold after the second casting, so that it not become clayed  & reheated & that which is inside not be burned. Do not forget to mix crocum  throughout your sand when you mold the crayfish , because you must really reheat it & the crocum  withstands this marvelously. To mold a crab  & to mold a crayfish  are exactly the same. When you have uncovered your crayfish  on one side do not delay at all before doing the second casting, because crayfish  dry out. It is not enough to uncover the crayfish  such that you see the whole half the half you uncover , but take heed that your mold, even when you are uncovering, be good and stripped, because if the crayfish  gets well burnt, you will not be able to open your mold without breaking it.
Restore it with a pen knife, little chisels, or engraving sticks.
As you see here, but a wax  casting all around & at the end of the tail, where you will do the principal casting, two or three more.
 Make the casting with candle wax shaped  in a thread like a large packthread, the whole length from the end of the claws to the extremity of the tail. If there is also some claw end or other part that is extended past the rank of the others or is raised up higher or turned up all alone, make a wax  casting for it from its end just barely not joined to the body or to one of the large claws or to some other place where lots of metal  will be wedged in.
Having uncovered it, attach & secure the two little bearded horns of the crayfish, and anything else that is not secured, with wax .

Molding grasshoppers  and things too thin
If you have to mold a piece of written-on paper  that is too thin, after you have done the first cast and it has set, give a little thickness to the reverse of your paper  with melted butter , which is the most appropriate means there is, & for strengthening the wings of either a butterfly  or a grasshopper , or any delicate part of an animal to which you need to give thickness. But take heed to apply this melted butter  under the wing or in whichever place it will not be seen.  For giving thickness to a pansy or other flowers, butter  is not good, but rather wheat oil , which is soon dry & holds firm.  Wax  would not be appropriate here for it is too hot once melted, and it makes the thing to which it is applied contract.  But butter  is amiable and handleable.
If you write on paper  or on common carton  and your letters are made with gum , the moisture of the clay  plate (?) or the wet (?) sand for a noyau will moisten your letters and  undo them.  Write therefore with cinnabar  mixed with oil , on oiled & stamped (?) paper .
+ Reheat your molds with charcoal  firstly lit in the forge, so that the fire is not too hot and does not break the molds.  And do not fire as strongly where the mold is thin as where it is thick.

Molds
Make some notches in them the molds  that enter more into the inside of the mold than the outside because in this way, they have more strength.  Take care to keep from reheating them suddenly in a burning hot fire, because this will make them break.
Do not keep them molds  in a humid place, nor an enclosed place if they are not well dry, because they will mold.  The same with dried animals.
It is not at all necessary to reheat the molds two times when the animal can pull away without burning, as do toads , which can very well be molded hollow like all thick animals. However, it is always good to redden the mold once.

Lute  for luting  your molds
I have not found a lute  that is made more quickly than this one, nor a better one. Take some of the lean earth  that artillery founders  and bell founders  use to make their trusseaulx and molds, which is lean and sandy.  Soak it moderately like a very thick mortar . Mix into it about one half of horse manure  and then beat it well.  Afterwards mix in one third of cloth waste  or cloth shavings  and beat it again quite strongly.  You can reheat your mold as soon as the lute  is ready.

Moulding turtles  and tortoises 
The turtle the one that lives in water  is more beautiful to mold because it has prettier scales and straight legs.  And the tortoises  have crooked ones. They eat a lot. To get ready to kill them, open their mouth and pass a long penknife through all the intestines. And then make it swallow some vinegar  mixed with spirits  or urine , as one does for snakes. It is necessary to mould them in several pieces, and even the back sometimes because the sides of certain ones are narrower than others and in this instance do not release from the cast .  To make them die, you must not boil them, because they come apart, even the shell, in the hot water .  They the shells  come out better when  hollowed because their great thickness spoils the mold. Turtles  are more lively. The tortoises  are leaner, slower, and more sleepy.  If you scratch turtles  on their shells, no matter how sleepy they are, they move; tortoises  do not.
They turtles/tortoises   die rather quickly in vinegar  mixed with a little spirits  or urine , as with all other animals.
They turtles/tortoises   keep their eyes closed in the winter, and appear as dead, having been numbed by the cold.  They hide in the earth or under balls of grain or warm manure, and survive only on the dampness of the earth .
You must not mold them too soon after they die because they are still stiff.  But on the day after, you will be able to manipulate them and bend their legs as you wish.

Moulders  from Foix 
Those who mould from across the way  make their sand from crocum  ferri and calcinated slate , but slate  always retains its bumpiness and swells because it is a fatty. In the noyau, it is not good; in sand, it can be put to use.  They the moulders from Foix   sieve their sand, grind it on porphyry , and soak it in water , and they keep the finest bits which are on the top, then they reheat it.

Toad 
Having been molded, you can take it out it without burning it, because it releases easily from the mold.  Choose the biggest and the lumpiest toads  .  Because they contain a lot of metal, it is best to mold them hollow, since they turn out better.  You could make your cast in one great piece, but it would be troublesome to cut.  It is best to do it in three or 4 parts, which will be thicker close to the animal, and include the most amount of edge that is close to the cast/mold.  Make as well some casting conduits all the way from the end of the cast .
 
Let the mold cool rather than opening it, even for thick things.
 
 143v
 from one leg to another, so that the spread out limbs are in connection with one another due to the aforesaid casting conduits, which you will start in the waxless round parts that you have put at the edge of the legs to attract the metal.  In this way, because you are casting in wax , there is no danger chipping any part of the molded animal.  It's quicker to make the wax  casting conduits thus, because in this way you can  cast the second mold after the first , rather than wait to do them the conduits  after the mold has been recooked, because then, if possible, you will need to have everything ready.  You need to heat well, and even redden the molds where there are wax  conduits so that they melt and leave nothing inside.

Openwork carcanets
You can mold them "en noyau" like crayfish , first with one side being made higher with clay , which is hollow, and then you open it  from the other side and make the second casting.  You can just as well cast them  "en chassis", provided that they release well. If they do not, you can do a rough cast in wax , or you can fill up the cavities which do not release well with wax  or clay .

Iron  filings 
Because usually filings  are mixed with impurities, it is good to heat them over fire to burn the filth and then wash them in clear water . In this way, the dirt will rise to the top of the water , which you will throw out, and the good filings will go at the bottom.

Carnations
Because those that you usually cast are generally quite big, they are heavy.  And so for these, you make them with silver  leaf or slivers.

Turtles 
Turtles are much more beautiful and easier to mould than tortoises, being that they are flatter and have a longer head and tail, and straighter legs and release better than tortoises, who are scraggly, wrinkled, and deeply entrenched in their shells.  They tortoises  also have a rounder top shell which is however narrower on the sides than in the middle, which means that the top shell cannot be nicely molded in one go, like those top shells  of turtles.  Thus you will mould the top shell into two pieces, and the lower shell into  two, three, or four pieces according to their appropriateness. If you want to release your turtle from the mold without burning it, you must mold it in several pieces.  But if you want to burn what is inside, you can mold your top shell in one piece. So to get started, once you have completely killed it in vinegar and urine, as we know, leave it to fully dry out.  And clean it well with a cloth.  Then take your clay base place it on it, and scrape the base a bit so that the undershell fixes in. Having nevertheless previously arranged the head with a strong needle, as you do with other animals, holding it high by means of a bit of fresh clay that you will work with from beneath. Stretch the aforesaid head and legs with your little pincers. Once the head is in place, dextrously put a grain of yellow millet into each eye with the pincers, because as soon as they die, the eyes pop out and rot. You can do the same for any other animal with a large amaranth seed, a small one, or a grain of rapeseed. This done, you will arrange the legs, securing them with little iron needles.  And then plug with clay the holes all the empty spaces around the turtle, that is to say, what is in between the two shells, so that the sand does not hinder the releasing of it.  And because the legs must be lower than the bottom shell, make a little dimple in your clay base to accommodate them. Your turtle

When they are the well tender and mortifiees & left aside, in two or three days you will be able to bend and manipulate them better.

 having been thusly arranged and well cleaned with brushes, put the circle of clay  around the base. Then, with a roll of clay  placed on the middle of the back of the turtle , as you can see, and at the widest place, divide your mold. Next, oil  with your oiling  brush half the half of the shell you want to mold. If you sand is a bit thick, temper your sand with warm water , so that without burning yourself you can put your finger in it without burning it. And before casting it, rub the shell with spirits . And then cast your sand and let it take hold.  And note that all things that have shells, or that are hard, or do not yield as snakes  and lizards  do, must be oiled  to come out cleanly. The things that yield do not need this. Warm water  means that the tempered sand sits better on the oil , which otherwise would not work.  With the half turtle  having been thusly molded, separate it with its mold from its clay  base, which you will put aside to use when needed. Then clean your half-mold, join it and flatten it like for the others. But because there will be the roll of clay , the half mold will have more than just half the turtle  in it, cut and crop cleanly the excess clay  and clean everything well with the brushes.  Then at the top of the edge of the mold on the side where it is cut, at the halfway mark, make two notches as you have done with other molds. And flip the turtle  on its base, as it was, and secure the two legs that are not molded with iron  pins and fill the empty areas around it, up to the edge of the top shell with some clay . Then place the circle around it and place a roll of clay  on the first mold, a bit above the notches. And having oiled  the first half-mold and its notches and the shell of the turtle , and having also sprinkled it with spirits , warm your water , temper your sand with a bit of salt water , ammoniac , and the aforesaid hot water , make your cast. Having taken hold, keep the sides of the two molds neatly together, and for each side secure the joints, which are not prone to do so naturally, with two clamps, so that when you uncover the bottom of the turtle  the top joint does not open. Then open the side with the belly and the throat, in the same manner that you would open a crayfish , which is the hardest animal to mold of all animals that are molded in two parts.
  You can also mold your turtle  in one piece for each side, but you will need to burn it.  And then to make the hollow, the recooked mold cannot be well-oiled  because it absorbs the oil .

Casting in three frames
You can cast bronze  mortars and similar things which release well in three frames. That is to say the body of the mortar in one, its noyau in the other, and the base of the mortar in the third one, because otherwise the cast which is there will not release well.

Cuttlefish bone 
You must not the the tin  or lead  too hotly, otherwise they will burn the bone  and become lumpy. And to know when it is the right temperature, dip in it a little piece of twisted paper . If it turns black without catching fire, it is the right temperature. But if it burns & catches fire, it is too hot. You can cast gold  & silver , but it never comes out neatly. To cast something delicate well, it is necessary that the bone  not be extremely dry, because it is rough & does not release as well & crumbles & is brittle. In any case, before you cast, dry them the bones   & especially for gold , which does not react well to humidity. You will know that they are dry enough when, after having exposed the insides and the imprint to the fire, they hiss & crackle when you bring them near your ear. Now join the bone s & daub the joints with a little lute  and slowly dry it near the fire & cast & then shake the mold or scratch the rough crannies and let it cool down before opening it. Usually one cuts the bone  in the middle, and the dull part that does not have half circles   is more delicate and smoother to mold with, and therefore one always uses it to do the main part of the casting, the other part of the cuttlefish bone   is crumbly on the inside as on the outside. Therefore one does not use this to cast delicate things which need to be molded in two places. One evens out & flattens these two halves on some piece of wood, then one rubs some charcoal  on top sot that it releases well. And to make sure the charcoal  is evenly spread everywhere, tap the side of the hand which is holding the half bone . Both having been covered in charcoal , take the first bone  that has been prepared & rounded on the edges, and having placed the medal above it, press the medal down strongly.
 
 145v
 But with fingers you cannot press evenly, because if you press on the edges, the middle will remain hollow. Start therefore with the middle, & then do the edges. But to do it better, put something flat & even on the medal, or some large square file, & press with that; because you will press evenly, sometimes with your knee, other times with your foot with your shoe taken off. & do it from above, so that you impress it without breaking it. If it is not well molded on the first go, do it again several times. Then restore and flatten your halves of molded bone from the sides. And to cut them well, always start from the most tractable part, coming out to the shell. And if your medal does not come out on its own, scratch the rough bone from behind and it will strip. When you want to cast, settle & affix the two bones with little pins of wood & in order to cast neatly, you have only to try it with sand.

Moulding herbs and flowers
You do not need thin sheets of clay , because the herbs and flowers will not lay on it, but as it were in the air, not touching any thing from any side, so you only have need of a circle & contour that is higher than for flat molds. And in this way, take heed to make it strong and thick, with the heft that you find suitable. Otherwise, it will sink in when the sand is inside. Fix & fortify it well with your foot & firmly attach all the joints. Then, have your flower well attached & assuredly fixed to the bottom of the casting with wax  that is not at all rough, but smooth, so that it can strip off well. Then moisten your flower or herb in good spirits  in a tall glass.

When you mold them, if they are not strong enough to hold themselves upright, run a thread through the mold to keep them lest they do not hoist themselves up. & cast the sand little by little & continuously and blow on it strongly and constantly so that it covers everywhere. Otherwise, it will become lumpy. Since you won't put anything in thin sheets of clay , the mold sometimes sticks to the table on which you mold. To release it, strike a great blow on the side of the table with a hammer.
 
It's enough to reheat your clayed mold once for flowers & to heat it the second time if you cast in tin  & lead , insomuch as for gold  & silver , you have to reheat it twice.

When very red, cast your tin into the mold when it is so hot that you cannot?  hold your finger in the hole without  .

 so that it is wet everywhere. If not, wet it with a large brush dedicated to this. Then pass the end of an iron  wire that holds the wax  casting through the end of the mold that closes the circle and have the iron  cleave the clay  mold as you see; & position it on the bottom, attending that the herb or flower does not touch anything, and leave some thickness to your mold, because the moistened sand always elevates the herb or flower. Even so, if it isn't thick of its own accord, pass a slender thread through the flower with a needle to keep it elevated. Or, if you forget this, lower the flower with a little stick just until the cast sand starts to thicken. With your flower well-positioned, take a platter large enough to moisten all the sand that you will need to fill the mold. Put a little sal ammoniac water  in it, and then some spring water , and when your platter is almost full, put a sprinkle of your sand on it, & mix it, & steep it until it becomes totally uniform, because if it were to clot it would consume the mold. For flowers it does not need to be very thick. And likewise, at the beginning, when you just barely pour it so it remains transparent on your flower & covers it sort of half way, blow strongly everywhere so that you eliminate the little bubbles, and afterwards finish filling it & blow, always slightly tilting your mold down towards its larger side. And if you find some remainder of thick sand that was not well soaked, set it rather close to the casting than otherwise. Then you can cast some thicker moistened sand to make it set sooner. I molded a marigold, with its leaves, in this manner. Crocum ferri  is safer for flowers, and when there is some crocum , clay it with the same sand that has already been used and is the most excellent of all.


The stem on which I cast a large branch of marigold with its flower, its buds and its leaves came out neatly, just like nature, was made of one lb. of fine tin  mixed with two ounces of lead .

If there are a few froths, fix it with a pen knife.

Uncover the molded flower while gently breaking the mold with the point of a knife. And, even better, soak it well in water . Afterwards, try a pig brush at the end of an iron  wire, etc.

When the mold is reheated for the first time, leave it to cool down halfway. Then, run an iron  wire gentle through the casting to make an opening for the burned ash inside. Afterwards, blow inside with a bellows and turn the mold over on the casting to make everything leave, & sometimes blow and suck in with your mouth.

Heed that you not attach the stem of the flower too firmly to the casting with wax , lest it consume something when you remove the wax  from the casting. To remove it, you have to loosen it a bit all around & then draw it out by the iron  wire with little pincers.

Moldingturtles 
This page is the continuation of the preceding second page.Since you have cleanly uncovered the part of the belly of turtle , its underparts, its throat, and its legs, and having cleaned it all well, do not forget to neatly uncover the cavity that these animals have in their shell between the neck and the shoulders. Turtles  do not have as deep of a cavity as tortoises , which are more scraggly, and even amongst those, there are some that have a deeper cavity than others.  Do not therefore forget to neatly uncover all of this in order to better represent its likeness.  But if there is a cavity which spirals too much inside, and is not visible, nor releases well, apply some small lumps of wax  and with heated needles of thick iron  and work the aforesaid wax .  Then plug the entrance to all of these cavities with soft clay . Put the circle of clay  around the mold, which has already been made of two pieces and contains the back of the turtle . And to mold its belly, you must separate it in three as you can see.  That is to say, you will put a roll of clay  on top of the throat and another one on the edge of the shell of its tail, so that only the shell of the entire stomach will be accessible to be molded on its own.  Having oiled  the shell of the belly and having rubbed it with spirits , thrown you slightly thick sand, which has been tempered with hot water  as before.  Having taken hold, remove the rolls of clay , then uncover the front and back legs, that is to say the bottom bit, and the throat and the tail, and remove the clay of all the cavities in one go if you can, because this will show you if the cavity will release well.  And if the removed clay  carries with it some of the wax  you have applied, put it back into the places that did not release well, as has been said.  And if some bit of the turtle  has come away with the clay , or fallen off, attach and rejoin it to the mold with some wax , using a heated iron  needle.  Do not forget to put some melted wax  at the edge of the turtle 's nails when you cast.  Having molded and uncovered the shell of the belly, you will see the mold in this way.# 
   
 147r
 Be warned to make an edge of wax  melted with a warm wire  all around the edge of the top shell which is close to the tail in order to make a better cast. And make it so that two small strings of the same wax  goes from the end of the shell of the belly to the aforesaid wax  edge, which is around the backbone of the shell, and the turtle 's tail should stay in between those two strings.  This to make a better cast.  This done, oil  your mold and what you can see of the shell.  Put the circle around this, and cast with hot water  as before, and doing what you have done in the same manner to mold the third part which is the tail. And having taken hold, take away the clay  contours, clean your mold, bring it together, and flatten it on all sides with a knife as you have done with other molds.  Lightly dip it in water , then try to release it.  Usually, one starts by the shell of the back, which is to say the top mold that is made of two halves.  And this one is easier to release.  The other follows directly after, but because it is next to the turtle 's shoulders which are deeply entrenched, it is sometimes troublesome to do this when lightly shaking and pulling the mold.  Be advised to pull the easiest one first, because you will need to release them one after the other. The hardest one of all is the one molding the throat, the underside of the legs, and the cavities of the shoulders, which are so difficult to release, that if you do not plan accordingly by filling it with wax rather than molding what cannot been released, it will be difficult to take the pieces without breaking something.  But if it happens to you again, there is a solution, provided that you keep the broken pieces, because you can reassemble them with stong iron needles, and fill whatever crack or flaw you have with some melted wax and hot iron as you have with others so that the noyau to mold hollow is easier to do.

See the second page
To prevent breaking while releasing, be advised to  uncover up to the point where it can still hold.

 + Casting with copper  alloyed with ☾  , which is like very low solder  and ard... es and old K  and some Re out of xii
I have cast the cleanest I have ever seen, making very small figures as thin as paper. I have cast extremely hot in the very red mold, and have put into the melted mixture the two compositions which makes silver  runny, and have done as if I wanted to throw with pure silver .  This league  is white when it boils, as with every other alloy which contains even just a small bit of silver . To cast something very delicate, use this.

Lute 
There is none better than the one you have used to mold, that is to say lumps from your molds.  But you need to choose some of the better recooked ones.

Crucible
Beware that it should be three fingers away from the mouth of the bellows and that the aforesaid bellows is positioned underneath the bottom of the crucible, otherwise it will cool it down.

Latten  casting
I have taken the one you find in latten  skillets, which have been beaten and forged quite thinly.  Having well-heated it, I threw in two or three grains, like beads of sal ammonicac .  This will clarify it like a mirror, having turned very white from all the heating, I threw in it some crushed raw and pure calamine .  The I casted it in its very red mold. Il cast cleanly and thin like paper , and hollow on the back.  Because it has become crusty I cooked it again, which to means to say, I reddened it, and left it to cool, then put it in bleach , made partly with raw tartar  and half of common salt .  Having boiled it well, I brushed it in clear water , because the first time it was
Do not let it cool down when melting. It always makes into filaments, as you would find with melted glass , because of the calamine .  Usually, the soft letten  of skillets, becomes red from casting, even when it has been in the fire for a longtime, because the calamine  evaporates.  But the brittle letten  of candleholders becomes yellow, as well as the filings  made of needles.

Beautiful color for brass 
Having cleaned it well, as is stated, and brushed it well, boil it in water with curcuma root  or terra merita , and it will become very beautiful.

Bleach 
If it is for silver , do not grind your tartar  with something made of iron , but with the handle of a hammer, because if you touch your tartar with iron  and end up  getting some iron  in your bleach , the silver  will come out red, like copper , and you will need to reheat it and put it back in the bleach .  Mix in nothing with your tartar  that should not enter the bleach , because this ruins it. Do not let it spill out when it first starts to boil because all its strength is in it at this point .  Bleach  is made with one part pulverized tartar  and a half part of common salt .

Moulding the foot of the bittern, or eagle, or other birds for the base of saltcellars or vases
One commonly molds the foot and the legs up until the calf.  And for this effect, one molds it in five pieces: the leg in two pieces, the top of the foot in two, and the bottom in one piece.

Crocum Ferri 
To make this quickly, redden the filings  in an iron  ladle, stirring it often.  Then sprinkle it with some good vinegar  and let it evaporate.  And without taking it away from above the fire, let it redden and take flame.  Having been cooled, pulverise it  on the marble  and return it to the heat, sprinkle with vinegar , and then set it on fire.  In this way it will soon be colored and made fine.

Molding turtles 
Join the parts of your mold and fix very carefully clamps on all joints, which are on the top, the bottom and the sides of the mold; do not forget to notch the joints as you did with the other moulds. Once you have fixed all the clamps, remove the sides ones, not the others. Thus your mold, made of several pieces, will open as if it was only made of two parts. If you want to mould hollow, pierce a hole big enough to thread the end of your little finger in the middle of your mold's belly. Widen the outside of the hole, like clervois, in order to cast the core. You could avoid all these difficulties if you didn't mold hollow; you could then mold your turtle  in two pieces, more quickly, and burn it inside of the mold like other animals. But a turtle  is weighty, and would be heavy if not molded hollow. This is why it is considered better to mold it that way.  It takes three days to make the proper hollow  mould. To mold hollow and fantastic forms , you need very strong plaster  which can withstand fire without bursting. But if you can't get this kind of plaster , add to it a little more stone alum , and also add crocum , which fortifies it the plaster   and makes the flaws -- if there are any -- so fine that they can be easily removed. Do not forget to tighten your mould with a press in order to avoid flaws that happen when your mold is not tight enough, or when it bursts. To repair it, if the lines are not apparent enough retrace with a burin, then soften the lines with a ciselet. You can remove the flaws with a chaple,  a kind of burin. For the lumps  and crumbly bits, they can be made with a gadet  or a  small carving tool which isn't hammered, and hitting with a small file.
Make this hole before joining the mould.

Softening iron  and making it really soft
Take some sublimate , some quicklime , soap from Venice , some horse manure , use less sublimate  than the other ingredients. Moisten all of them together, forming a paste and apply this to the iron , and wrap the whole thing in a dirty rag. Then reheat it until it becomes very red. Or leave it overnight in a good fire until the morning.  It will be very soft and you will be able to engrave whatever you wish on it.

Gold of lesser quality from Germany , Electre 
One calls it gold  from the Rhine , which you can find in the rivers, and it comes in gold flakes. German goldsmiths  wanted to refine it, thinking that they could separate it from the whitenes, which they thought was silver . But it always stayed white, which proves that this whiteness is fixed and it's only fault lies in its color. This is electre , from which you can make cups, which will reveal poison.

Various arts from Germany 
They make great use of water mills, and most of these artisans working with gold , silver , and any other metal, bring their large works to the mills to be hammered.  And to pull iron thread , they heat large amounts of iron , making it into a point, they hang it up still red, and very quickly pull it.

Reparing medals
If you want to mold any medal to use as a model, and at the same time repair it, cast it in a greater quantity of tin , and put in it a good amount of tin alloy  to make it harder.

Molding vases in several pieces
Goldsmiths  who make large works and crockery use a turning lathe to get the model they wish in wood. Then with some wax , the goldsmiths  model on top of this the masks, festoons, or anything that they wish. Then they mould the model in three, four, or several pieces.

Gold  solder
They take on a gold  penny a small pinch of refined aloc , as you would find in old sous. 

Molding flies 
Large flies  can be molded & cast. But you must apply underneath their wings some wheat oil , which dries quickly and firms them up & gives them a little thickness. The same thing can be done with butterflies , cicadas , grasshoppers  & similar things. But to cast them more easily, you must set them on some leaf or bouquet. The others should be placed by hand on a very slender silver  blade. You cannot keep your insects when they are dead, since they will dry out and their legs will break.
Wheat oil  should be put underneath delicate things to make them more rigid & firm, & to make them hold their natural posture, since being weak & delicate, the tempered sand, adding weight to them, would change their form.

Bats 
They have very thin wings and if they are large & dry and the wings are extended, you need a very big mold & it is not certain that the metal  will run sufficiently; thus, when you want to mold some, choose the medium-sized ones & and arrange them so that they have  their wings are half folded, since in this way they will come out better. But be sure to apply, as you known, some wax  on the side of the wings, so that the cast flows well.

 150r
Very strong wax 
Mix with this some resin  and bole . Do not cast very hot.

Diverse ligues of tin  and lead 
For hollow things like turtles , use  half refined lead  and half tin .
For flowers, use  almost all lead , that is to say, a lb of refined tin , and two ℥  of refined lead .
For lizards  that are as thick as one or two fingers, use  almost all lead , that is to say, a lb of refined lead  and 4 ℥  of refined tin .

Moulds
They are less prone to cracking while reheating when they are very thick, rather than thin, provided that thickness is sufficient. Because when they are thin, they do not need to be fired for long, and prolonged exposure to heat corrupts them. The same thing will happen if you plaster  is not strong.
It is better to reheat one mold on its own, rather than heating it with others, because should this be the case, you will need a stronger and hotter fire, than for just the one mold . And because charcoal  will accumulate between multiple molds, the heat will transfer from mold to mold in such a way that you will often find that your molds have burst and crack on one side more than the other.
Therefore reheat your molds, not applying fire, except to cover it.
And because your lead  and tin  become brittle when melting the over high heat, in order to make them less brittle, heat them over low heat, and cast in stick form.
Brick cools the metal , and if this is not for binding, it is not necessary.
The reheated moulds cannot withstand several casts, but the ones in which you only cast tin  or lead  and flat medals, these being dry, withstand a lot of casts.
Iron filings  being finely ground, makes them molds  very firm and strong.

Molding hollow
This iron  thread needle which you put thusly in the mold, is to better secure the noyau and keep it from shifting.  All of this having been thusly arranged, lay your mold on the table, hole facing upwards, as it is explained at the side. And then fashion a circle made of soft clay , of about two fingers high around the hole, as you have done with other molds. And then temper your molding sand to an average thickness, and throw it in the hole until it mold  is very very full, that is to say until you reach the clay  circle. Be advised not to throw it sand  in the middle of the hole, but from the sides, because the already made mold, will drink and suck the moisture.  And the new sand that you throw on the sides of the mold, because drying quickly, will plug the mold and not leave you enough time  to fill up. Whereas if you throw it the sand  from the side, when you realize it is drying too quickly  and plugs up, you can make a path for it.  Having thrown it in, blow on the tempered sand, and insert the tip of your finger in the hole a few times, or some kind of pointy thing to keep it moist, in order to make sure that the hollow wax  does not fill up. At the end throw in the thicker tempered sand to strengthen the mold, because when water  rises up to the edge of the mold, it always makes it softer.  Having taken hold, get rid of the clay  circle and any raised parts that relate to the hole through which you threw the noyau, and you will not even realize the process took place. Once your mold has been thusly prepared, lute its outside with the same sand that you used to make the mold.  Then reheat it on with a low heat to begin with, slant the mouth of the cast downwards so that the wax  trickles out slowly, because if you reheat it over very high heat to make the wax  come out, it will boil inside it the mold , and will leave blisters and lumpy bits on it the cast , as long as

This iron  thread needle is placed in the middle and the hole of the cast, when the mold is in many pieces, as is the one for turtles .  And you do this so that the noyau does not shift.  But when the mold is made out of only two pieces, it is not necessary to put needles in the middle.
  
Rather than cast the noyau, make some notches around the edge of the hole through which you would like to cast, so that your mold is even more secure.
Mixed tallow  means that when you empty your wax  when you are emptying the mold of wax , it does not clog.
You will need half tallow  and half black wax .
Every thick piece comes out better when molded hollow, because a thick mass of mostly lead will stay warm for a long time and eat away at the mold.
After the cast, you can mold the part of the shell of the belly where you made your hole on the real thing animal  and fix it with solder .
X Note that after your noyau has been cast, it is better to put your mold in hot water  to open it, so that you can take away as much wax  as you can, always softening it in the hot water . Because the less wax  you have on it, the better it is, because it will reboil when you reheat your mold, and you will get blisters and lumps. And if you have little wax  left in the mold  you will not need to reheat it as much.  When you open your mold the cast will break.  But it can easily be repaired as long as you castA

 the white wax  you have used to make black sulfured wax  has so little substance, being dry and purified, that it leaves nothing with it the mold mentioned in the first part of this recipe  and trickles very gently. As for the coal  which is mixed in it, if there is some left, it burns and reduces to ash, and can be taken out afterwards by blowing into the cast.  You can open your mold after the wax  has been melted, if it does not contain a fantastical piece which could break, which are like pieces added on or similar.  After having covered the clamps with lute  from your sand, and having covered the entire mold, add to this a layer of common luth , and then sprinkle ground brick  so that you can better manipulate it.  Leave the lute  to dry slowly, rather than putting it in the fire, which will melt the wax .  The wax , having exited the cast, that which remains of it, mixed up with the charcoal , will burn. Having reheated it for the first time, lute  it again, because should your plaster  be bad, it will have eaten away at the mold and it will be found in the space between joints, which can result in large overflow. And for the second time, you must not reheat it if you want to cast only in lead  or in tin , simply make sure that the lute  is very dry and your mold attains an average heat.  For those very large turtles  that have enough thickness, it is better to cast using an alloy of half tin  and half lead , as you do with hollow things.  Because if you only need to cast very thin and fragile things like flowers, rely instead on using more lead  than tin , which bubbles when cast a bit thickly and will easily some flaws to your cast. Mr. Alexander says he has never gone astray with using half tin  and half lead  for things that are heavy and as thick as the back of a knife.  If there is crocum , you will not be able to clearly see the joints and as a consequence the metal overflow is very small and thin.  You can repair this, and through the hole of the belly draw out the earth from the noyau, leaving it to soak for a long time.
When you have thrown your black wax  in the mold and it has well-cooled, you will have to open half of your mold to make your cast.  Should your black wax  figure break, there is no danger, because it can always be reattached with a hot iron  needle. Or if the pieces have not separated well from their mold, they will meet up and join as before, by joining and tightening the two halves of the mold. When your figure is big, you must interweave more iron  threads inside to give support to the noyau.
 
A only in lead or in tin. You must however heat the mold as much as if you were about to burn an animal inside, so that the wax  melts well and leaves nothing inside, and trickles out while holding the mold slanted towards the cast and at the same time reheating it. And when the mold has been reheated, leave it to cool slowly, then blow inside and suck out the wax ashes. Do this with a bellows.

 However, do not remove it before you have prepared the whole turtle , because you will use this earth  as cement , should you need embed something or make repairs with a chisel. If you have some metal overflow at the joints of your mold, you will remove it, either with a burin, called a chaple, or with a very sharp pen-knife, or with a small file followed by the chisel.  Always keeping in front of you the real thing to do as best you can. You can curl on a file a chisel point, which is not at all moistened, to make something lumpy. For these turtles  and any other hollow things which you can assume are quite big, create a ligue  of half lead  and half refined tin . There is more to do when molding a turtle  than when molding a dozen flowers.  If there is crocum  in your sand, there will be no metal overflow and if you are unfortunate enough that there should be some on the sides, these will be as thin as paper , as long as your mold is very tightly pressed together.  And to make the scales of turtles  and other animals, you can make little chisel marks in the shape of round punch cutters, others in the shape of a gouge, or shaped like a snake  or lizard  scale, and other using a file used to make twisty bits and lumps. Turtles  that do not need to be molded hollow are not as much work, because they are molded in two pieces and repair them with little chisels that make  punch cutters, little couge, and serrated chisels.
 

Wheat oil 
You must make it between two empty iron  blades, the bottom one in particular will be slanted downwards and on this one you will put an even and equal layer  of wheat .  Then you will place on it the other blade , which is very hot, and you will press it down until you see the black oil  drip. Remove the top blade when you have enough.  This oil  dries very quickly.  It gilds silver  and varnished things, deepens the color of gilded things, can be used  as a varnish  on iron  before you engrave it, and to varnish the tanned leather  parts  of sword hilts.  And it could also be used by those who make gilded leather  .
You must use this, as has been done recently.  And for things you need to mold, it must not be as thick as for dyeing.

You cannot use this to oil hairy animals, because it is too strong and rigid, but it is good to apply to the foot of a little animal, like a fly  and other similar things. It is also excellent to dye white stones

Molding a rat 
The hairs of his whiskers are difficult to come out of the mold, you can therefore shave them with fire, as did the tyrant of Syracuse , which you can always replace with life-like silver  ones. The tail comes out beautifully because it is made of little scale-like circles, almost like the ones of a lizard .  And to make sure that the hair does not keep you from molding well, burn them away with a little candle. The rest of the body must be oiled with wheat oil , which will keep the hair rigid and flat, so that it will not be removed when it mixes with the sand, which will keep you cast from releasing cleanly.  Wheat oil , being dry, will dry quickly, you will therefore be able to comb the hair with a very fine comb, so that the hair will be visible when cast.  On a small mouse  you can use common oil  to flatten the hair.  Rather than molding these animals immediately (except for snakes  and lizards ), keep them dead for a day a two so that they become easier to handle.  Because they are very stiff after they die and cannot be shaped into a life-like looking position unless they are softened.  However, if you mold it straight after it dies, and give it its shape before it becomes stiff, that will be good.  And because the eyes die unless you mold them immediately, you can replace them with half a round pea  taken out of its shell.  Some cast their rats  without any added preparations; others oil them with olive oil  which suits the purpose, because wheat oil  is thick and has too much body.  This is why we only use it wheat oil  in light strokes on fly 's feet or beneath a wing, to keep them stiff. Others flatten the hair with an egg yolk , which dries quickly and does the job.  Arrange it the rat   on its clay  base before oiling it.  Raise its head with an iron  needle, and also secure its feet with needles, and it tail.  Rub it with spirits  after the oil  has dried.  Then throw in your sand. Uncover it as you would other animals, then do your second casting.  You must not open the mold until it is completely reheated and the rat  has burned away.
+ If it is a big rat , it is better to cast it hollow, because it is thick.  A mouse  is easier to mold because it has shorter hair.  It is impossible to mold an animal with big bones well, such as a bird or rat , without opening the mold to clean it well, because bones do not burn well.
All kinds of feathers and hairs are difficult to mold realistically.
It is better to use butter  to grease hairy animals than wheat oil , because it is better suited to the purpose.
If the rat  is big, it is better to remove its entrails, or having molded it, let it dry in an oven, because the large amount of moisture it contains would boil inside the mold, which would ruin it and make it lumpy.
Only put your mold in the oven after it has cooled, drying slowly, otherwise it will absorb the moisture and break.

Repairing things that have been cast

It happens often that what you have cast has metal overflow, through a fault in the mold, the cast, or the metal . Faults in the mold arise from plaster  which is not hard and strong and cannot withstand fire, which is corrected by mixing in crocum . If you use too much tin  to cast things that are of an average thickness, it will not release well, because tin that is cast thickly, shrinks and bubbles.  Similarly, the things you need to mold hollow can be fantastical to cast.  If therefore you happen to have a flaw, have at your disposal a small leather  pouch full of fine sand, and having placed it on the edge of a goldsmith 's bench, where one files, place upon it your work, and secure it there with a rope which passes underneath your foot.  The sand in your pouch will respond to the pressure of your foot , and will immediately be thicker on one side and thinner on the other.  Then immediately with a burin, outline and quickly make the subtle parts of your cast which did not come out, or which did not come out distinctly enough, or with a file or a chaple, remove your metal  overflow. If there is  a flaw in your materials that has left a hole or something too hollow, scrape it with a burin and make notches around that hole, then make an imprint of this with wax .  And place this imprint on a fine lead  blade, and in this way mark the appropriate size of lead , or of any other alloy which resembles your casting material the most.  Then place this piece of work on the notched part and attach it well with some with yellow latten  or copper  wire - and if you are dealing with tin  or lead  rub in some rosin  around the edge - and apply all around it the replacement piece  some little thin pieces of solder  or tin , or any other thing.  Then with a hot iron , or above the heat source of the forge, solder it together, and then repair all of this with the aforesaid tools and the appropriate chisels.

For gold  or a small work, you will need to attach them to a lead  ball, which you will then place on the leather  pouch and it will help secure the piece with the rope.

Moulding the hollow part of a mold for seals or other things
Firstly fashion your figure in wax  on an even slab of glass  or slate . After, mold it with our aforesaid sand, having beforehand lightly oiled it with oil  as you know, and having rubbed it with spirits , while tempering your sand with hot water .  Having made the hollow part, cast it in lead , using the same alloy as you do for other figures that come out very neatly. However, if it does not release cleanly, repair it.  And then mold you lead  relief with some wax . After, in your wax  hollow part, throw in your tempered sand which will give you a relief, upon which you will cast your hollow part with silver , or any other metal used for seals.  But note that you must not make your hollow part with melted wax , but only with wax  warmed in hot water , or even better in hot urine . Or else, if you have a relief in gold  or silver , or any other very neat and flawless metal, mold your wax  hollow part directly upon it, and throw your sand in it wax hollow , which will form your relief, upon which you will cast your hollow part to make your seal or any other work.  You could also cast a hollow part directly from the main part of your metal, even should you want to cast  in lead  or tin , which will not make the main part of your metal melt, if it has been lightly brushed with crushed chalk , or covered with candle soot , or with dried egg white .
When you have the wax  imprint of your seal, mold in a noyau this piece of wax , which is hollow like your seal, and your noyau will make a mold similar to the imprint and the seal.
Your wax  must be mixed with a color that has little body, so that you may better see your imprint.  The lamp black  or soot black  is good for this.  White wax  to do this is even better.

Giving a medal the thickness that you wish
Having cast your first mold, mix some crocum  or well-ground iron scales  to make it your mould  firmer. And having taken hold, and made your hollow part very neat, take some paste made of fine
 
 153v
 flour .  And to flatten it, take a small stick of wood  that is round and of an even thickness, which has at both ends a small circle that sticks out from the rest, in order to give the necessary thickness to your paste .  And then with this rolling pin, flatten it so that it becomes thin and tenuous. Then apply it on the hollow part of your mold and press it down with cotton , and your figure will impress itself on the paste, in relief on one side, and hollow on the other.  This done, with a brush that is dipped in melted butter , grease the part of the paste  that is hollow.  Then trim off the extra paste  which extends beyond the hollow of the mold.  Also oil  your mold with olive oil , as you have done with others. Apply your clay  contour, and cast your second mold. And you will have a medal as thin and hollow on one side as you wish.  You can have various rolling pins which some edges are more raised than others, in order to make various thicknesses, or you can use sheets lead  and copper  of various thicknesses, or cardboard , all cut with the rolling pin.
 If you were to oil  your paste , the paste  would absorb the oil  and it the oil  would penetrate through the paste , right up to the edge of the mold and attack it.  But butter  remains on the surface of the paste , and does not penetrate it.  For these back bits, you must not temper your sand with hot water , because it will melt the butter .   

Testing the virtues and strength of sand that is to be reheated
Once the sand has taken hold, you must find it soft and easy to cut, and not surly.  It is better to test it in a large and fantastical mold, rather than a small one, because the big one will stay in the fire longer and the small one reheats very quickly.

Softening gold 
Sometimes, you can find gold  that is so dry that neither cement  nor antimony  can soften it.  Only verdigris  can soften this gold .

 154r
Removing gold 
Gold  as gilding goes away if the coin is reheated and placed against a strong fire, even if there is lead , because lead , which contains much mercury  will pierce a gold  coin in a fire.

Cutting lead 
Because it lead   is fat, hard to catch and corrosive to the knife and the scissors, wet it up and you will be able to  cut it like glass .

Sometimes, gold  and silver , exposed to a certain kind of smoke, take on a coloration during the casting. But these are neither flakes nor coat but a colour which will go away during the whitening.

Softening silver 
When goldsmiths  who work on a large scale have forged their plates, to their loss these plates  quite often break and crack because they have been sharpened too much. In order to avoid this, when it is quite melted, throw in ground dry mortar  made of sand  and good lime  which has been used before.
Goldsmiths  do not work with silver  from real  because it is rich in lead  and becomes sour when forged.
For small works and things that need to go only once to the fire, some weld with some old sol  or carolus  reheated and beaten. However if the sol  is not quite good enough , the welding will not hold as there is too much copper  and one will have to weld twice. Others weld with an alloy made of  half silver  and half fine copper .

Iron  flakes
Once it is quite ground and refined on the marble  slab and mixed with the sand  from the core mold , dry it slowing without reheating it, and it will allow for several casting of lead  and tin . Copper  and brass  come out fine of it. But if it is not ground as finely as crocum , it sinks unless the sand  is soaked and quite thick.

Metal file dust 
It does not melt by itself if it is not helped with some portion of similar metal  melted to assemble it and bathe it, as it is more burnt than melted. File dust  from tin  and lead  are made with tallow , file dust   from gold  with saltpeter , file dust   from silver  with sandever. 

 154v
Latten 
Latten  is wonderful to cast. It is necessary to be cast very hot. And to master it better, throw in some sal ammoniac  to clarify it. You can also add a bit a red copper , and if you wish to, add in a bit of tin  to make it runnier.  It always leaves filaments like melted glass . It does not require as long of a cast as others.

Moulding
It is a good thing that it be cooled on the outside, but nevertheless remain hot on the inside, because when it comes out of the fire, the air and the strong fumes from the fire do not reheat the cast well. 

Casting silver 
Silver  requires a long cast, whereas for gold  it does not matter. Silver , when soldering, withstands the water  you throw at it. Whereas gold  sizzles, and because of this one throws its ? on the solder .

Let the mold cool well after the casting, rather than opening it.

Strengthening flowers and delicate things
For flowers and small plants, do not use wheat oil . Instead, use some melted butter  which you will apply lightly with a small brush on the back of the rose leaves, and pansies and any other flower that needs it. But one reinforces the little feet of flies  and other small animals with wheat  oil to make them stronger and hold up.

Strawberries 
The leaves are cast separately and then rejoined with solder.  And because the strawberry fruit is cast solid, and because of this it is heavy, and the tin  stem is slender, it will not be able to sustain weight  without breaking quickly. One makes the stems with latten  thread and then solder them back onto the fruit.

 155r
Moulding a rose
Because of the little branches of the rose bush, which are around the flower, are sometimes very spread out, they would demand too big of a mold. We make and cast them separately, the rose and the rosebuds separately as well.  And then one brings them together, soldering the little branches and leaves of the rose bush to the stem of the rose, on which you will have purposefully left bits of the small branches.  Put your petal or rose as low as you can in your mould, because sand  will always bring it up or raise it.  You can also mould several petals together, arranged one on top of the other, separating them some thread.  And for the look of the rose you can give a thin layer of melted butter  on the back of the petals, but only on the outside petals, not the inside petals, to stiffen them and give them the strength to withstand, so that the wet sand does not stretch or spread them out more than necessary.  You can also mold well the leaves of a rosebush, strawberry plant and similar things, that are flat and can be flattened without being spoiled. For two castings, to open your mould, when it has been reheated and then clean the ashes out, make some vents, and you will be able to do  several casts. This is the easiest way and you can also do the other.  And with little veins of wax  that has been adapted and joined from leaf to leaf, you can make casts. You can even make a little vein of wax  from the back of the first petal, which will join up with the main cast.  All of this will facilitate the casting process. The main thing is to let your reheated moulds cool down rather than cleaning them and blowing inside them to make the wax come out, because when the mold is hot, the ash almost attaches itself to it.  But when it is cold it, it detaches and leaves with air draft or when one draw in one's breath through the small opening. 
 
You can also give a little thickness at the ends of the stems that are holding up the petals, by lightly oiling them underneath with melted butter , because the petals are big and weigh heavily, and the stem made of lead  or tin  will not have enough strength to hold it .

I would be of the opinion to mold the rose on its own with a bit of its stem close to its bud, and then to join the rose to a longer one a stem  made of glazed brass , because the rose bloom is very big and heavy.

Moisten your rose with spirits  before placing it in the clay. Do not forget to oil the wax  cast. And when you have thrown in your wet sand , blow heavily, until it begins to set.  The rose came out well.  But because the sand  was mixed within the petals, soak your work in water for a long time so that when you shake it in the water, the earth comes off.

 155v
Rose
Because the rose bloom is rather wavy, and its petals are all mixed up and arranged in various ways, it will not be beautiful if it is not painted, and you must also consider that its weight cannot supported by the tin  stem which is sour and fine.  One moulds the flower of the rose in a separate mould, casting it thickly so that it comes out more easily. Then one cuts the cast at the edges of the stem of the bud, in which you graft and solder a stalk of brass wire to which you also solder the leaves. But because this tin , being so thin, is hard to solder, and may melt some of the leaves and also the cast flowers;  you should consider  that cast flowers, especially roses, are not beautiful without being painted, so one does not make the effort to solder them, but instead  one grafts the pieces that you want to join together and glues them with fish glue  that has been a little moistened and melted until thick. And so that it takes better, you heat the work in tin  lightly and for a long time,  because if it is cold, the glue  will not take.  Once your flower is thusly repaired, you follow the joints of the added parts with some esbaucher wax , which is a white wax  mixed with much well-ground ceruse,  or even better, white lead,  melting it and placing it on your work with a small warm bit of iron  needle.  In the same way you can repair the little filaments that are in the middle of the rose, or the holes that may appear in some of the petals. Then paint your rose realistically. If you cast your rose in gold  or silver , you can also rejoin parts  and solder its. And in those materials, when you have join something very delicate together with the flower, such as a fly or other similar things, fish glue  is excellent, and holds very well, fixing it with a few little needles that act as nails. The leaves and buds can be cast in two molds that can be opened once they have been reheated, but not before.  Then these things join up with the flower .

Quickly molding and reducing a relief to a hollow mold 
Make an impression in colored wax of the relief of your medal. And you will get a hollow mold, in which you can cast en noyau a relief in sand. In this, you will cast your hollow in lead or tin. In this, you you will cast your wax relief. And then on this wax , you will make your hollow moule en noyau, in order to cast in it the relief in gold  or silver  or any other metal you would like.  But to make this process go faster, if you are in a hurry, make the first impression and the first hollow out of the inside portion of the bread  loaf, prepared as you know, and which will cast neatly.  And inside this, cast in the melted wax  which will give you a nice relief on which you can make your noyau.

Work of gold , very light and hollow
Cast a lizard or any medal you would like in silver , of low quality, then gild it lightly and once the first gilding is done and dried up in the fire, burnish it, brush it with a wirebrush.  Apply another layer of light gilding, repeating the whole process. Do this three or four times or even more depending on how thick you want your gold  to be.  Then, in the most discrete place you can find, make a small opening, and submerge your entire work in some good aqua fortis,  which will penetrate into the silver  through the opening and will corrode the silver  without damaging the gold .  In this way, you will have a lizard that is hollow until the tip of its nails or any type of work that is so light that when you blow into it, it moves.  But be advised not to apply a thick layer of amalgamated gold  in one go, or apply layers that are too thin each time, because this will block the finer details, but if you proceed as I have said, i.e.  lightly and in many goes, and cleaning it well, then you will be fine.

If you want the aqua fortis to corrode well, you must cast in low quality silver.

Chiseling
Lead  is so fat and soft that one cannot hammer it harshly, one should have a light touch. Other big metals are easier to work with.  With a graver called an onglete, you make and retool the finest of details.  With the ordinary graver, you make the larger ones, and with the chaple, you can remove the bits that have run, and with the …  soften …  some lines you flatten or raise the lines.

 156v
Moulding a fly
Take the fattest flies, that go to pantries, which are not hairy, if at all possible. If they are hairy, oil lightly their fur and their unmanageable hairs with olive oil to make them lie flat.  Take them also and use them as quickly as you can after they have died, because it you leave them to dry out, their legs will break when you want to stretch them. You must also, to get a better cast, arrange them on some kind of leaf or other similar thing.  This will help to cast their little legs, that are so fragile that unaided, they will not cast easily.  They can be arranged on a sage leaf or something similar.  They cast well in gold or silver but one usually the legs and wings separately and then join them to the main body.  I have cast one on a bouquet of sage that had seven or eight leaves. And to arrange it, I affixed the legs on the largest leaf with a bit of melted wax and joined them with the pointed tip of a hot iron wire.  And to make sure that the wings will eventually  join more easily to the body , I applied on the underside some melted butter with a small brush. And with same pointed end of a warm iron wire I applied wheatgerm oil on the legs and feet.  To tame and bed the downy hair that it has I also apply a bit of olive oil. 
I do not let wheatgerm oil dry out a lot because it is very thick and has body, and the spirits cannot penetrate it.
For applications, tallow is too harsh, pork fat is too soft, and but is excellent because it is rather dry and curdles and instantly melts and is firmer.  Be advised that the legs and feet are well set on the leaf, and not go beyond the leaf, because the whatever exceeds the leaf will not cast as well, even if cast in silver, because these parts are so fine that they will not cast. And truthfully, feet set on a leaf, cast well, but those set from leaf to leaf which remain iffy did not come out well in tin.  The rest of the fly was cast, and likewise the sage bouquet which cast very beautifully.

You could also cast them well in gold or silver without the feet, and without attaching to a flower by casting it underneath the belly and then joining the feet with soldering. And if you need to, cast the wings in the same metal and it could be enameled if you fortify the wings and feet as previously said.

If your sage leaf or your branch needs to be repaired, do as I have said below. And then paint in a realistic way.
 

Having been cast in gold, one enamels the wings with window glass from Lorraine, which is and  transparent.

It is necessary to cast the fly from the ass with some melted wax, fitted by an iron tip, as you know, to which the fly attaches itself, and then the wax, as it melts, serves as a cast for the fly.
 + 

If it happens that you have some defects with your fly's wings, hammer some very fine tin, or gold or silver, if you cast it, and shape with scissors the amount you need for your wings. And then apply it with tweezers and glue it with fish glue, applied like it is shown below.  And before doing thing this heat your work lightly so that its coldness does not repel the glue, which will dry quickly, heating it from afar.  Then cover lightly the joints of whatever you've attached to the cast with some esbaucher wax, which is a white wax that is mixed with a lot of ceruse or white lead, melting it with a warm iron point. You will also cut little bits of harpsicord string and will glue them with the aforementioned glue when they are dry. It is to know, the feet, having been reworked thusly, you will make them bigger with this same melted wax so that they are equal in proportion with the rest .

The mode in which goldsmiths  mold hollow molds

They mold their animal, or another solid work that they have already made or rough-hewn in wax  and cast in lead , in two cuttlefish bones. When it is good and impressed in the two cuttlefish bones, they put a piece of paper  between the two bones & join the bones and cast. The work comes in parts by halves. And then with a chisel they dig into the two half castings of gold  or silver  as subtly as they like, and then they solder or braze them.

Bright red

Some goldsmiths  try it out on finely beaten gold that is well burnished with a chisel. But it is better to try it out on a gold  ingot, and to test it as well on a work or   your materials fantastic, since if they look good & extraordinary on a big work, they will show excellently on a common work.

Flies 
They mold better on a single leaf than on a bouquet or a flower or the branch of an herb, since the single leaf is molded in two halves that being reheated can be opened up and cleaned well, & the cast will be better. In picking up the fly, take heed that you do not break its legs or let it dry out too much, because then the legs will fall off. And if this happens to you, glue the same legs back on with fish glue  and wax , or adapt the hairs of a pig  or the cords of a spinet . Fix the leaf on a flat piece of clay  with two pins, and the fly with one pin in the middle of its body & the feet with wax.

Cleaning and degreasing your cast tin  works, and others
Make some lye passed through scrupulously with good ashes , and it should be new & without any fat; boil your molded work in it. And the tallow and fat will leave.

Arranging an herb or flower to cast

Always put the front side of the thing on the upper side because it will come out better and neater than the lower side. Make the casting large & prepare the supraplus, which is the mass, after the founders  of large castings, even for silver , which needs a very hot mold & is cast very hot. Very fine thing must be cast very hot.


When you know that the stem of a flower burned in a mold that will not open at all is totally reduced to ashes, this is the sign that everything else is well-burned.

 157v
Ashes in the moulds
You must let the mold cool down rather than blow into it to try to get the ashes out.  Because when the mold is hot, the ashes stick to it, and when it cold, they separate from it more easily, and will exit by blowing with le vent a vapeur.

Moulding a bird 
You must give it its pose. And to do so, place it on its side on a clay  base and hide it in the aforesaid clay  base and sink half the aforesaid bird  in it, so that it is only showing one leg and foot, then you will apply butter  to keep the feathers down and then apply some spirits .  Then cast it.  And having taken hold, clean and uncover what needs to be uncovered.  Because the feet are made of bones which are hard to burn, and which will not be able to be cleaned neither with quicksilver , nor by any other means, if the mold does not open, uncover the bottom of the foot and the toe, or the nail of the claw, and mold it with a separate piece.  Make a second cooking and open your mold and clean the bones.  Feet generally remain too  weak to support the a heavy bird .  Because of this one adapts an iron  thread in the foot mold which goes through the body before you cast.  In this way they are reinforced.  Some mold the wings in a frame.  Some mold the head and the aforesaid wings separately en noyau, then reattach and repair them to start shaping the bird  , which will firstly have a rigid shape and support the tempered sand.
They are skinned and filled with cotton cloth .  And for the best result, you must prepare it in the way that leather-workers  do, so that they do not lose their comely feathers.  The preparation is made of alum  and flour paste .

Mercury  in molds, for cleaning

Take heed that your mold be quite cold when you blow in order to get the ashes  out. And afterwards put in ☿  in order to finish the cleaning. Because if the mold is hot, the ☿  will go inside & seek out the conduits in escaping, & will leave its own odor, which will aggravate the tin  or other metal  that you will cast, such that it will break in touching the mold at all. The heat of the mold also retains some little grains of ☿  that will make lumps & stick to the sides of the molded leaves and attach to them & make them frangible. The ☿  cleans ashes well. Likewise flat things where there are not delicate traces that it could break with its weight. And therefore, if you can cast neatly without putting it in, don't use it at all. But if you have need of it, mix your crocum sand  so that it withstands fire well. And after having put in the ☿ , evacuate it, bouncing the end of the mold from below while moving it. Afterwards reheat your mold gently so that the ☿  is gone from everywhere. In this way I cast a branch of periwinkle leaves & flowers very neatly. Having put a branch of melted   in the flower, on the back of the flower  .


Reheat your mold until it is good and red before casting, so that the ☿  evaporates well.

Colors for green leafs
One usually paints them with oil colors, because distemper colors do not stay on. For marigold flowers, lightly ground minium for some of them; for more yellowish ones, mix in a bit of massicot. For green, the vert-de-gris is dark and too somber. If it is a yellowish-green, you can mix with the vert-de-gris a bit of yellow ochre and scudegrum. If the green is dark, mix in some coals made from peach pits, which makes a greenish-black, in the same way than the bone of an ox foot bone makes a bluish-black. And in such a manner, by judgement and discretion, put the color on the natural flower or leaf to see whether it is similar to the original. But paint it on very lightly so as not to cover the features of the work.

Large molds
Because of the heaviness of the metal, it is necessary to put them in a press so that they do not open.

Candle smoke
It allows the piece to be taken out more easily, and even if it is slightly thick, it does not stick because it has no substance. I have perfumed my core molds this way for tin and lead, and I have casted in a cold mold, but drying it well beforehand, and the piece came out quite cleanly. It is true that lead mixed with half the quantity of tin, because the medal was very thick, was very hot.

Casts
If the medal is very thick, do not pour a cast that is as thick; the cast just needs to be half as thick as the medal. But if it is thin, make a cast that is of the same thickness. Do not forget to make vents in the cast or the whole matter will fill with bubbles.

Never forget to oil the cast with wax when you cast herbs or flowers, otherwise it will break and cannot be taken out.

Portraits in Wax 

If you do not mix your wax  with any color dye , and if you paint some colors on the wax , these colors would fade if you cast it en noyau. But the representation is not damaged, rub it very lightly with spirits diluted with hot water . If your representations are varnished, repeat the molding process two or three times in order to remove this varnish  which sticks to the mold. When the varnish  is removed, your mold is very clean. If your representation is set on wood , it is necessary to pour very hot melted wax  on the wood,  otherwise the mold sticks to the wood . It is much better to mix your white wax  with white lead  than ceruse , because white lead  is whiter and more firm.

 
Chasing tool

If a chasing tool has passed through any part of the representation, it is necessary to rework the whole thing and follow it all again. Otherwise it would look like an additional piece.

Fish glue 

Beat it very finely and thinly on a well-cleaned anvil, then dilute your glue  with spirits , put the mixture on hot ashes , and on a low fire, it will melt very soon. If the glue  is not strong and thick enough, add spirits  in greater quantity. Do not melt it in a fatty pot , but in a new pot  if possible. It melts on fire and dries very quickly on fire. When your glue  sets on the work, heat it away from fire, it will stick very strongly. One reworks flowers and delicate things made from silver , gold , tin  and other metal  with this glue  which will not spoil your work.

Tin  and lead 

They must be beaten out very finely and tin  will not get brittle or break, lead  is a bit fatter. But that is why it is necessary to reheat it under hot ashes, and to beat several leaves together.

 159v
 Cleaning files
Sometimes they get fat from the grease of lead , which is naturally fat, or also filings corrode them. And you will be able to clean them with hot charcoal  or a wire brush made from brass. 

Carnation
Mold a carnation like a rose, marigold, and all other flowers as discussed, that is to say cast the flowers in one mold, and the leaves in two parts in order to solder them onto the flower, this is the better way. But you could mold the flower and the leaves together in one single closed mold. I tried one which came out well from the mold. But the sand  must be very thin, and you must blow very strongly.
 
Molds
Try to make one side as thick as the other, that way the two parts will be equally reheated. You can open this kind of mold in order to clean it, when you mold some animals, like crayfish, which burn. When your mold is reheated, do not wait too long before casting again, because it gets damp and loses its strength.

Unmixed plaster 
If you reheat plaster  as a stone it would crumble into water , but if you grind it before reheating it, it will not crumble into water , on the contrary it will harden in water, if it is good plaster like the one from Paris or from Spain which is as hard as a stone, and which is found through poor and dry earths, and which looks like white salt . German people use this plaster  to make statues for their fountains, even if the statues are varnished they will not be damaged with water . On the contrary harden this plaster with water . When this sand  is unmixed it sets much sooner. Oil very lightly your shapes of metal or of other materials otherwise you will not be able to strip plaster  from the mold. And dip your mold into hot water  in order to open it, if it does not open in hot water , it could open into boiling water .

It is sometimes even necessary to boil the mold in hot water , as you would with wax  if you were afraid it would not strip well.


Cold water draws oil out to the surface of the plaster that has sucked it in and thus it strips.

Presses for large moulds
  It is made of two sheets of iron, fasten with four small iron pillars, in such a way that the upper sheet is able to move and run freely along the pillars, while the lower one is fixed. A St André cross, made of iron, stops at the end of the pillars; there is a screw in the middle of the cross, which squeezes the sheets against the molds placed between them.
For small molds, we make a frame; having put the mold between two metal sheets, we squeeze it in the frame with  for  small moulds, put the mould between two iron sheets, and squeeze it  with wedges.
Big wooden presses, with a screw, apart from being heavy to move to the furnace for casting, make it difficult to see when they squeeze too much, and they often break the molds.
The screw is fixed to these nuts which are nailed down the upper plate, this way it raises and presses the mould.

Sand  to cast flowers 
In casting with thick sand , flowers  crumple; it squeezes them into a mass. For this reason, be sure to dilute your sand  very thinly, and blow on it so the flowers  are not entirely covered. When you dilute your sand , do not only stir it with the small shovel, but beat it as you would egg white. 

 160v
Moulding a foot or a hand
Mix resin  to the wax . Once well blended, soften the mixture in hot water  or urine . Then press the foot or the hand  in the mixture in order to get an impress, then pour plaster;  the cast will which will be clean and come off easily.

Fine work made of gold  or silver 
You can mold flies by hand,without casting; the wings and the feet can be soldered, which you could not do with fine works of lead  or tin , because they would melt. You can enamel the work made of gold .

Catching crayfishes
On the end of a stick, attach pieces of liver or lung, from beef or mutton. Then hang a basket to the stick with a little string. Put the basket into water where crayfishes eat; they will soon aggregate on the flesh. Pull very gently your stick out of the water; the crayfishes which will try to return to the water will fall into the basket.

Catching passerines
If they sleep in the farmyard, like they commonly do, close to the house, let the closest window open, and put a lighted candle close to the window. The candle itself must be hidden, only its glimmer must be seen through the room and through the window; all the passerines will then lock themselves into the room. But the night must be very dark, without any moonlight.

Catching birds
During winter, when birds have molted, skin them and fill them with cloth and stuffing, or dry them well in an oven. Then arrange your birds on trees, have some look like they are  singing, look like they have assembled  and are numerous.
the oven must not be too hot. This method  is good in the summer, because flies would set into the eyes and make works before they birds  could dry. You can work on the birds more easily in the winter, because they dry by themselves.

 161r
Preparing sand  for box molds
After your sand which is made  of gip de lateribus  and alumen jameni  is moulded as a core, gather the left-over pieces of your mould, and break them up on a long table with a big metal block until they are very well crushed. And for an even better result, sieve them neatly.  Place them in the oven pots of tile-makers,  in a bread oven, firing them  several times, when it is well heated so that they become very red. When cooled down, rebreak them if you need to and sieve them. After, put them in a vaisse, a semal or a vessel that is appropriate and clean. And then wet it with clear water.   And crush it and mix it with a big stick until it is very well-moistened and rinsed, and the dirty parts rise to the surface of the water.  Keep stirring in this way the dulled gip , that one prepares to gilt burnished gold  over five or six days, until it is in no way lumpy. And each time your stir it, leave it to rest and cull the clear water  that will be on the top by tipping the pot, or with a porringer, or with a sponge. And put in some new clean water  and in this way wash and stir until it is refined and purged of all filth. Then leave to drain a little bit and to dry and make of it some balls, soaked in sal ammoniac . Having been thus dried, put them to be recooked in very high heat in a reverberatory furnace for a good amount of time, where they will become very red. Having been recooked in this way, crush them and try to mold something in a box mold, having moistened your crushed powder with water of sal ammoniac . And reheat and redden you box mold, and if your sand  comes away, then you must crush it again and moisten it again with water of sal ammoniac . Remold it in two balls and recook it and redden it and continue this for as many times as necessary until it does not come away from the box mold when the box mold is reddened. The main thing is for it to be well recooked, because otherwise the sal ammoniac  will not calcinate well and will make the sand  coarse. And for this reason, you should not put in too much sal ammoniac .
#  Note that before drying it, you must first wet the whole thing and empty the liquid in another ordinary vessel, taking out the litharge , so that the stones  and the earth  remain at the bottom afterwards. You must leave it to rest and then empty the water  by tipping it, and then leave it.

Crocum ferri 
It can be made quickly if you put very filings that are very neat and have been washed in an iron  drum that is only two fingers high, and cover it, and redden in a reverberation furnace, having washed it in good vinegar  for a whole day.  And it will be very well burnt and clean, mixed and crushed on a marble  slab. Having been well crushed and when well mixed, the vinegar  will corrode it easily and will redden it quickly and bind it. Wet it with the strongest one you can find and burn it after. And after three or four wettings and burnings it will be ready. This one will be the color of columbine and is considered firmer for casting than the one that is redder and more beautiful in color, done with rusty filings and has more color in it. Some burn the filings many times on a shovel of red iron , watering each time with vinegar .

For La Boutique

According to Herodotus the Portuguese did not invent deep sea  navigation as they put about. At the beginning of the first book entitled Clio, he says that the Phoenicians used to come navigating straight across from the Red Sea to the Greek coast, mainly to Argos, where they would bring merchandise from Egypt and Assyria, which they usually sold out within 6 days.


Navigation, commerce

Herodotus, page 1 of Clio, says that the Greeks traveled in a long ship to the coast of Colchis and to the River Phasis, where they carried off Medea.

Galleys.

Herodotus, page 3, says that Gyges offered to the temple of Delphi "pateras aureas sex pondo 30 talentorum".


Gold vases

Halyattes, the father of Cresus, "pateram ex ferro compactilem apud Delphos dedicavit spectatu dignam inter omnia quae sunt Delphis donaria, opus Glauci Chii qui solus omnium compactionem ferri excogitavit." Compactile ferrum means made by assembling separate parts.


Iron vase assembled and soldered
 As small peddlers lay open small wares in order to buy more precious ones & to make more and more profits, I also, from a desire to learn, am laying open the little that is in my boutique  in order to have through  receive through a common commerce des lettres  much rarer secrets from my benevolent readers.


Aes ustum 

When it is finely ground it moulds very cleanly. It has a certain fatness that makes it bind better than filings, I believe that it may not be ill suited for casting.


Rotten wood

Wood that is white, being light as a sponge, if burnt in a close fire, may be used for casting lead in a box and molds very cleanly, but these things such material  do not withstand open?  fire. 

 162v
Peach trees
Because they bud and blossom from the outset, and so are caught by the frost. We expose their roots during winter so that the cold slows them down, and they blossom later, which benefits their flowers.

Olive trees
In Spain  they expose their roots during winter and in spring they earth them up again.

Foot of bittern 
To mold it it is better to extend its fingers and nails on something flat and let them dry this way for a few days, because in drying the scales will be rougher and the nerves and and tendons will be more apparent, and so the molded foot will be more artistic.

Molds of things which have not been

pelted
Animals who have not been pelted can only be molded in a double mold, which can only be opened after they have been refired and after the enclosed animal is completely burnt. Animals with bones or scales which are not reducible to powder thus remain in calcined pieces which will never removed from the cast, however much bellowing or whatever amount of quicksilver is put in, or by using a feather pipe while molding to make a gate. This is why you mold in two halves: so that once the mold is opened after having been refired, the thing you've burnt can be cleaned out. But I advise letting it cool so that in taking off the clamps (being hot) nothing cracks while it is still fragile. While it is hot the crust and cinders which it leaves and which stick to the mold can be more easily removed when it is cold. Also note that on the side of the lower mold when you reheat the animal, which in boiling leaves a crust, in this case, always mark on the mold where the back of the animal is so that in reheating it is to the top and above and will by this method stay cleaner.

 163r
Perfume-makers 
They readily make their perfumes with half amber  and half musk , and a little civet , because the scent of amber  is stronger than the scent of musk .
To save using amber , perfume-makers  readily add add a small quantity of musk  to the white layers, in order to get a stronger scent. But to remove or hide the blackness of musk , they add a bit of starch  from England , which is perfectly white.
To give off a scent of white amber , in the same way that the Portuguese  do, take a chunk of amber  that you have broken up into pieces.  Having put in a small silver  porringer a spoon of flower oil , should you not have some, linseed oil .  That is to say, use the type of silver  spoon one might use at the table.  Pour into this your ambergris , then place it on a low fire, it will melt quickly if your amber  is of good quality, and there will be no lumps.  Having melted it all, put in a small bit of civet , and melt it all and blend it well together.  Then take your gloves which you have cleaned and dried properly, and lightly dip the edge of your finger around the edge of the oil , with patience slowly spread the oil  along the glove, and rub the glove between your hands and trace along the fingers and its stitches, one after the other.  Leave it to dry.  Then repeat the previous procedure until you have used up all of the amber .

Spirits 
Spirits  are excellent for making molds clean, in such a way that where you do not apply some, common sand will attack the figure. But it needs to be passed three times. And because it does not take well on oiled things, I believe it may be best to put some into the water  with which you have moistened your sand.

 163v
Crayfish 
The hairy little horns that it the crayfish   has under its snout tend to come out lumpy and unclear because, after they are burnt, it is difficult to remove and clean away their ash, which, staying in the mold, prevents the metal  from running well. And for this reason, one makes a small gate of wax  thread at the tips of them, in order both to hold them up and to blow away the cumbersome ashes from inside.
Do not spare any pins, placing them not only in the middle of the body, but also on the big legs, and two or three on the tail, according to the positioning that you want to give it.

Crocum 
That which has become rusty by itself, having been doused with water , salt , and either vinegar  or urine , and then well-dried and reddened by heating, is deep red when crushed on porphyry  and is of the color of bol de levant , almost like minium . But that which is doused with urine  and dried acquires a deeper color and almost like crushed aes ustum  or like vermillion . But the first one, finely crushed, acquires a bright red color like cinnabar  when placed in spirits . And the one and the other, when prepared as said above, finely ground and made very hot, produce a red smoke like an acid vapor if, being thus hot and fine, one throws vinegar , urine  or spirits  on top. The urine  makes a lot of color and the spirits  as well.
 
Repairing
It is much better to only lightly repair your work with a burin called an "onglet" or the one called "chaple" or with a small file. Above all, avoid touching your work, but touch only the burr or lumpy parts that will have occurred during the casting. While reworking, moisten and rub your work with a small bristle  brush.

 164r
Casting

When you make a cast of delicate animals, like snakes , start by casting the belly side, or the under-tail, for this side has straighter lines which are easier to rework than the back side, which is more veined and is more marked.

Repairing burrs

Remove burrs very carefully with the point of a chaple or a burin, then scrape the burrs with the side of a burin, or carefully with a small file, and rub with willow coals  and small brushes. Continue, also, with the lines not interrupted by burrs.

Leaded silver 

A lot of silver   is wasted because of the lead  which is mixed with it, as occurs in cupellation, and makes it leap in small bits onto the edges of the crucible and onto the charcoal  which covers it and is also gross. And by this means, it is good to melt silver coins , like reals and others, and make them into ingots prior to casting lizards  or animals , for it comes out better. I cleanly molded a small, silver viper , like in the first recipe above . And at the end of the line of 4 reals  (of 20 S of Spain ), and one coin  of 20 S from France .

Blowing

When you smelt silver  and gold  do not blow too hard or with force, because the charcoal  will become spent and the crucible will sink and, potentially, spill over. But when your mold is ready, blow strongly in order to properly heat the silver  or gold . When all are melted it is necessary to blow over the top with a small bellows, doing the same for gold , for it removes and reduces the smoke.

 164v
Molds

For molds wherein something must be burned (away), and do not open before being reheated: do not cast before refiring/reheating. For large molds that produce large and wide casts, it is necessary to score it with strong notches so that the pitch  of the metal does not run as forcefully. These will not make many burrs if they are pressed. Prior to doing so, place between the mold and the press pieces of thick felt for mittens , which will fill the cavities and protect the mold from cracking. The clamps should be placed prior to heating or drying.

When the ground from which you are making your earthen base to lay out your animal  is too soft, the pins you place come out easily when you cast the sand and so the mold is spoilt and the design is defeated. Therefore when you know that your slab is too tender and soft, spread some hot cinders over it and blow with the bellows.

Sable

If you don't add enough alum de plume  or crocus your mold  will easily crack when heated. But if your sand  is mixed as it ought to be, the mold  will sustain itself. You'll know it's of good quality when, while still hot after casting, it immoderately soaks up the water  when dipped and breaks easily, because the alum  and the crocus  render it spongy. To the contrary, bad sand, which is composed of plaster  and brick  and is not well mixed with alum , breaks easily in fire and hardens in water . If possible, cast all at once.

Molds

When you cast lead , your molds must be very dry, even if the molds are large. The outside of the molds must be reddened, and it is necessary to keep them in continuous heat until they do not smoke anymore inside. Do not reheat your molds several times, but continue when you have begun and do not let them cool in the cold because they will crack. Let them cool near the fire. When your molds are still as warm as above, remark, you can put your finger into the casting gate without burning your skin. If your mold is large, it takes more time to cure and to dry, and you must also cast warmer.

 165r
To repair
If in your cast, there appear some little hole, fix it with black or gray filling gum wax .

Lacquer 
If, having been ground, you let it dry without keeping it in water , it will dry out and it will be quite difficult to crush it as before.

Stretching a canvas  portrait
If it is crumpled or folded from when it was rolled up, moisten the back side with a wet sponge. Then stretch it very evenly without damaging it.

Plaster  for molding
When it is long to set and dry, it means that it is too fat and moist, which is what makes it shrink away from the fire and crack. This is  where burrs come from.  The one that comes from lean earth  is better. You must not store your moulds made of fat plaster  for a long time, because they resemble fat earth , which when drying, cracks. The best is to reheat them soon after they have been made and cast. Moulds made of good plaster  can  be stored a long time.

It is necessary to oil it well, because it is more difficult to separate the two halves of these moulds than when it is mixed.

Dragon 's blood 
It is imitated with lake  that surpasses it in beauty if, with this distempered in oil , you glaze on gold  or silver . Distempered in varnish , it dies.

Repairing snakes  and lizards 
You could make some marks according to the form of their scales, making some bigger ones and some smaller ones, according to the shape of the neck, the body and the tail. If there is something broken, you can attach it with small iron  or steel  nails, and glue it with some mouth glue , then cover the whole thing with gray or black wax .  But it is necessary to let the glue  dry for one day without touching it.

 165v
Positioning animals
Not only with iron pins, but also with melted wax, are animals secured to the plate of earth. Wash them first in clear water, after they have died in the mixture of vinegar and urine. And with a sponge clean off their mouth, eyes and head of the froth coming out, because the sand would never set well there and would become lumpy.

If you want to keep their mouths open, insert a little bit of harpsichord string, which will not take up much space.

Keeping animals
Having molded them once, if you want to keep them for molding again, put them back into the mixture of urine, vinegar and spirits where you killed the others, and they will keep for a long time without decaying. If you have a cut on your hand, take care that this mixture does not touch it.

Molds
After molding them do not keep them for long, but use them as soon as you can, because when kept for a long time, they are prone to spoiling.
When your molds are reheated, the thing comes out better.

Lute
When reheating, you might as well use common lute, But when you want to cast, strip it from the mold and, using a brush, quickly apply a layer of plaster lute that has been used for molds, because it will be dry as soon as it settles, and cast. This lute should be mainly placed on the joints.

Silver
When it quivers after melting, that is a sign that it is very hot. And since it commonly contains much lead, it is good to throw in some lime mortar because that attracts and gathers in the lead.

Fly wings
So that they come out best, place wax sprues from the gate up to the tips of the wings. Also make sure there is enough wax under the belly, because that is what makes the cast succeed.
 
Attaching a fly wing or something similar
They can be attached with fish glue mixed with spirits over slow heat, heating also the work. Then that is covered with wax "à ébaucher", that should be grey.

For The Workshop

If anything has been omitted: the harvester is not blamed for leaving some corn ears. 
If some craftsmen complain that their craft secrets are being discovered, as the goddesses of Eleusis complained to N… the Pythagorean that their mysteries were disclosed, excuse yourself in the words of the ancient Hebrews quoted by Josephus.

As a hen will carefully search the rubbish thrown out of a house for a crumb or a seed to distribute to her chicks, so will the orphans receive whatever has been discovered in those arts that are considered vile and despicable.

Tablet of Cebes: idle. But The Workshop represents all things active. 

If the jealous will disapprove picking up these things and taking them from others, reply that since "Nullum est jam dictum quod non dictum aut factum sit prius" and it is commonly believed that all arts were invented within a thousand years, do not imagine you could invent anything new but rather rediscover the long-buried, unknown and forgotten books of Numa in order to reveal them to those who are ignorant of them; and that, just as the day before teaches the day after, you also needed to learn from those before you in order to teach those after you. The Latins learnt from the Greeks, as Cicero did from Plato and Virgil from Homer (Aulus Gellius). Valerius Maximus only reawakened various authors who had written previously, and Livy's 23rd book revived  the 2nd or 3rd book of Polybius. Among the Egyptians, Serapis was deemed the inventor of agriculture, but among the Sicilians, it was Ceres. Pythagoras and others from Tyana learnt during their travels those disciplines which, back in their countries, they claimed to have invented. Does one not call a weaver the maker of his precious cloth or fabric, even though he did not himself dye and twine the yarn  nor wind and prepare the reels and balls of thread? Is a mason not the builder of the house, for picking up ready-made stones? "Apollo a Chirone medicari didicit & tamen deus medicinae habitus." "Homerus Orphei poema imitatus est, nam cum Orpheus sic prius exorsus esset, 'Iram cane dea Cereris frugiferentis', ita reddit Homerus, 'Iram cane dea Pelidae Achillis'". In Justino martire, Circa princip.

In addition to Greek examples, there is a psalm of David mentioned by Saint Athanasius in the Synopsis. It begins "Parvus eram" and in the second verse the royal prophet says, "Manus meae fecerunt organum et digiti mei aptarunt psalterium."

Keeping chestnuts 
They must be left in their burs until you want to eat them. And in their burs, store them in a humid place, or in the drain of some roof.

Scented candle  from Le Mans 
They melt in with wax  and candles rosin  that is called in France rosin  from Burgundy , which is white and not as rough or dry as the other rosin . They also perfume the wick and the end of the wick.

Softening gold 
Dissolve some caput mortuum  in distilled vinegar . Filter and congeal in salt and cement the ☉   with this, and it will soften wonderfully.

Improve the color of gold 
Put some aqua fortis made with vitriol  on hot embers. Cover the bottle, that is, the vent, with a tile. Then uncover it and a thick smoke will come out in which you put the gold  and it will take on an excellent color.

 167r
Mortars
 Mortars are made of the best alloy of métal   and the finest possible rosette   so that they do not burst, that is to say one part métal   and two parts  fine rosette  or old caudron, which is even better. Some of them are of fifteen or seventeen lb. and are loaded with two and a half lb. of grain powder , and they are put on common windows and doors. Others are of a weight of 25 to 27 lb. and are loaded with eight lb. of powder. And in such a way, they are made according to the stress they have to resist. On the outside, they are all the same shape, but in the inside, they are made like a crucible,   narrower on the inside of the bottom and getting wider towards the mouth. And this is to reinforce the bottom, given the quantity of powder they hold, and so that they do not burst. Those of 4 s. lb. are eight lignes  thick at the bottom, and get thinner in the inside towards the opening, which is of 4 lignes . They have xiii poulsses  long and seven in diameter at the mouth and opening.
 
 167v
 
The ones weighing about 27 lb. are ix "pousses" long and the mouth is 6 pousses  in diameter. At their bottom, they are 6 "lignes" thick, and 3 for the mouth. The ones weighing 17 lb are 8 "poulsses" long and the mouth is five poulsses . They are all covered together, all the forks, rods, and tools which one uses, with a big canvas or big cloth so that they do not make any noise. It is good that they sit loaded for a while. After the powder  has been put in, it is grinded very hard and then tightly pressed paper  is put in, then a cake of well pressed wax  and, on the wax , another slab of cork  that fits in very snugly and that you have to force in. In this way, the powder  remains well packed and gives much greater force, and if you wish, you can put on the cork  slab one of wood pierced in the middle, if the mortar has a pierced bottom, which is believed to be the easiest and which makes a greater hole because it cannot recoil. And for these that have a pierced bottom, one must have a good gimlet to first make the hole so that the rod, which is made by the point of the gimlet, has before and without noise attached the mortar. And for these, one must cover the button, which is quite sharply filed, with waxed canvas , or add wax  to it so that it completely plugs the hole in the bottom. But because the doors are sometimes iron and the iron rods cannot pierce it, an iron fork made like pincers and another iron stick made with three claws, like you see painted, are use. And in this way, the mortar stays in place well and is immediately steadied. The iron rods must come out of the mortar from every point made by the gimlet, namely by three or 4 finger lengths, which all enter in the door. When the mortars are placed, the touch-hole is filled with good powder  and inserted in it is a feather shaft  filled with tightly pressed powder  and moistened with vinegar , or if needed, the powder is firmly pressed with the palms of the hands and, having wet it with some saliva , you shape it like a cocoon or
 
 168r
  rod that we put into the touch-hole, and then, with a rope wrapped around the end of a baston, we ignite it and promptly retreat to take cover. The small mortars of 16 or 17 lb. are attached promptly with a short, hooked rod made like a wimble, and if it is of a good alloy, we can ignite it by hand. It is done in this way for mortars of 27 lb., but then we only put three lb. of powder. The door really needs to be strong so as not to be blown off for seventeenth lb. mortars. Some people use little bells worn by oxen or mules as an door for the mortars. Others load two canons of guns and, with a gimlet and a string, tie them with the opening against the door. If the mortars are good and do not explode, they only recoil and cannot harm if one is next to them.
A is a small rod, hooked like the hinge of a door and made as a biron on one end in order to quickly attach a small mortar with handles of fifteen or xvii lb. for a common door or window.
B is a small mortar with handles.
C is a common mortar of 27 or 30 lb. pierced at the bottom, where a large iron  rod passes, button-like on one end made like a biron on the tip so as to quickly hang the mortar against a door that will not be covered with iron  plates.
D These are slabs of wax , cork  and wood  for loading the mortar and well packing the powder.
E iron  fork made in the form of pincers as tall as a man, used to quickly set the mortar without a rod. It must be of soft iron  so that the sides fold easily, if needed, and to accommodate the height or width of the door.
F is another iron  fork of the same height that supports the fork made as pincers and also sustains the mortar, and with its low claw prevents the pincers from recoiling.
 
 168v
 G mortar with handles placed with its rod.
H knife-like saws to cut, if needed, a portcullis.
J the big iron  rods that cross and tie the mortar.
K are like iron  rods, all round and covered with cloths, like all the rest, so as to make the big iron  rods, pierced close to the button, turn.
L axes that one must always carry to chop and to break, in the fortuitous case that the mortar has left anything entirely.
M a large wood  mallet for knocking down what was begun and weakened by the axes and "birons".
N are big wheelwright augers and birons for easily cutting a door or window by making large holes close to one another.
O crutches as tall as a man that must be carried to put under a portcullis immediately after the canon has been shot and to prevent the portcullis from falling.
P are small iron  pincers for putting any low mortar against the bolt of a door.

They mould in paper  or cardboard , because neither sandy earth  nor metal  would mold so neatly and would not receive.  Or they engrave with stone  from Istre , for the main side, and the reverse is in paper  or cardboard .

Reducing a round form into a hollow one
You must firstly mold it with plaster  as has been said before, and in the plaster  throw in some wax  from which will come a relief that you will repair very neatly, and will shape at your pleasure.  Then you will mold this wax  relief once more in plaster , or even better with your tempered sand, # , as if for a noyau.  And in the latter throw in some lead  and from this you will have a very neat relief, and if it is not, repair it on cement  or a similar material, and beware that it should always release well.  And this one will always serve you as a model for making as many hollow molds as you would like.  In this way, place half of your lead  figure which you have oiled , and moisten it with spirits  as we have seen above, on your clay  base, then mold this half with a white plaster .  Having taken hold, and having smoothed and flattened the plaster , take your black wax  mixed with sulphur  as we have seen before, because it leaves nothing in the mold and melts quicker.  Dip it in hot urine , and once it is softened enough, make an imprint with it on your half figure in lead .  And you will have a very neat hollow mold.  Then adapt your wax  hollow mold into a square shape, as it pleases you, as long as you have sufficient thickness, and make sure it is well even on all sides, and then mold this hollow wax ; and having it imprinted on one side, and having it flat and even on the other, in the same way that you would mold a flat medal in wax  or metal  in a noyau.  And the noyau mold will give you, whether in silver  or any other metal you wish, a figure similar to the wax  one, which is to say, flat and even on one side, and hollow on the other.  And having cleaned this hollow, and having put it in the bleach , if it is made of silver , you can put into it some sugar  work
Having made a hole in your clay  base and having placed there your half figure in wax , oil  it a bit so that it comes out more easily.
Transparent wax  is not good as opposed to one that has body, for making good imprints.
 Because you have molded one of your halves with plaster  and wax , you can do the same thing to the other half.
 
 170r
 perfume  and similar things. But be sure that the black wax with which you cast is hard, so it will come off rapidly when dry so you can see if it has been stamped correctly. It can be made harder by adding more melted sulphur  in the melted wax , and a bit of resin .

Common medals
Relief awls are made of untempered steel , and then it is tempered. With it we beat on a matrice, not red hot on the fire as some people think, but on some steeled iron , reheated and adoulcy, that is then tempered.

Casting
Do not cast all at once because in doing so, the metal overflows and gets cold instead of going to the bottom of the mold . Rather, cast it bit by bit, and gently.

Iron  clamps
When you put them for the second time, make sure that the mould does not wobble.

Molds
Those with noyau, when reheated, should be placed on half lit charcoal , without being in contact with the air; like the frame molds, they need to dry in the open, and uncovered.

Thick tin  pieces
They should not be casted with lead  or red tin , like thin and fragile things. It is enough if they are well melted and hot. Fragile things need to be red hot and made of red tin .

How to clean closed molds
You have to leave them cool down rather than blow inside to clean them, because they hold the ashes when they are hot. Once cooled, they are easier to clean. Have a fine brass  wire or a thin straw to thoroughly clean the tail because it is through it that you cast. Blow into it and siphon, bringing it to you. Give it volume before casting the tail with wax , then cut it.
 
 
make a tail by soldering a latten  wire. The grains of a flower are quite little, so they can be removed with the chaple, but the leafs need to be peeled off correctly, then the paint will cover everything.
