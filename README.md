Modification of notebook with M&K data.

This notebook was originally prepared by Jonathan Reeve for use during a workshop called "[An Introduction to Visualizing Text with Python](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/dataviz-workshop)," which took place during Columbia's Art of Data Visualization week in April 2016 (see also the subsequent [2017 workshop repo](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/workshop-dataviz-2017)).
