<ab>You can make various grooved compartments &amp; in these, put

cover this with <m>very clear lantern horn</m>. You can apply the same

<head>Casting</head>

<ab>I have tried four kinds of <m>sand</m> for <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>:
<m>chalk</m>, <m><tl>pestled</tl> glass</m>, <m>tripoli</m> &amp; <m>burnt
linen</m>, all 4 excellent. But as for the <m>chalk</m>, it needs to
be of the softest kind you can find, like <m>the <pl>Champagne</pl> one
that <pro>painters</pro> use</m>. It releases very neatly, does not want
to be moistened with <m><fr>magistra</fr></m> or anything else, but needs to be
completely dry, in its natural state, finely
pulverized. The first cast is always the
neatest; however, it will well withstand two or three. But there is only
the first one that you need to take heed of, when you want to remake
your <tl>frame mold</tl> to take new <m>powdered chalk</m> that has not
yet been put to use, for the one previously used in the <tl>frame</tl> has
dried out &amp; does not have as much hold &amp; bond like the fresh one.
<m><tl>Pestled</tl> glass</m> can be made from <m>common glass sand</m>, however,
<m><fr>cristallin</fr></m> is more excellent, for common glass contains
<del><m>glass</m></del> <m>salt of saltwort</m> only, but
<m><fr>cristallin</fr></m> contains both <m>salt of tartar</m> &amp;
<m>saltwort</m> all together, which both help fusion, the <m>glass</m>
once calcined &amp; reduced as if to its prime substance. In order to
calcine it perfectly, throw your pieces of <m>glass</m>, whichever it be,
among the largest possible lit <m>charcoals</m> that you can, if you are
    lacking another amenity <del><fr>t</fr></del>for<comment rid="c_068r_04"/> violent fire<del><fr>t</fr></del>.<comment rid="c_068r_03"/>
And when it is well red, throw it into
<m>water</m></ab>
