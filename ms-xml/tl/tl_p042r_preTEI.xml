<ab>The <tl>mold of <m>earth</m></tl> is reheated until, sometimes, it
is as if red, for otherwise the <m>metal</m> would spatter &amp;
would not do anything good. And similarly, the <fr>noyau</fr> on the
inside should be very reheated, &amp; mixed with <m>charcoal
powder</m>.</ab>

<head><m>Wax</m> for seal and imprint</head>

<ab>For the large <m>wax</m> seals, you need to have <m>tepid water</m>
always ready &amp; <del><fr>apre</fr></del> keep your <m>wax</m> in
it. But before, it should have been kneaded between your <bp>hands</bp>
to render it very uniform, for otherwise the <m>water</m> that would get in
between would prevent it from becoming uniform. Next, you will press it into
whatever you want and put three or four pieces of <m>paper</m> on, &amp;
with a <tl>stick</tl> <del>you</del> even &amp; round like a
<tl>pestle</tl>, you will roll it as if you wanted to polish it, and it
will attach itself to the <m>paper</m>, which will help you lift it off
the <tl>mold</tl>. Thus you will imprint better than if you were to cast it
molten. You can carve the figures &amp; <m>gild</m> them, <m>silver</m> them, &amp;
paint them with <m>colors in varnish</m>, &amp; transfer them onto a
base of <m>glass</m> painted with <m>colors in turpentine &amp;
mastic</m>. And if you want to apply these plates by incrustation, do it
with <m>gum ammoniac </m> tempered with <m>vinegar</m>, and you will have
good <m>glue</m>.</ab>

<head>For casting in <m>plaster</m></head>

<ab>Melt some <m>wax</m>, &amp; with a large <tl>brush</tl> coat the
relief of which you want to have the hollow form, as if you wanted to paint
it. And a light crust <del>upon which <fr>qu</fr></del> will form,
upon which you will cast <del>you</del> <m>plaster</m>, to give it body
and strength. Next, in the hollow form of <m>wax</m>, you will also cast your
<m>plaster</m> in order to have your relief, &amp; it will release very
easily because of the <m>wax</m>. This is done more for large
pieces in high relief than for others.</ab>
