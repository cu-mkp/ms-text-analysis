<ab>one leg up to the other, in order that the spread out extremities
come to join one with the other by means of the said gates,
which you will start in the round parts, empty of <m>wax</m>, that you
have put at the end of the feet to attract the <m>metal</m>. Thus, the
gate being made by <m>wax</m>, you are in no danger of encrusting
something from the molded animal. And it is more expedient to make
thus the gate of <m>wax</m>, to cast the second <tl>mold</tl> on top, than to
wait to do them after the <tl>mold</tl> is
reheated <del><fr>q</fr></del>, for at that point, it is necessary, if
possible, that everything be ready. One needs to heat well &amp; evenly
redden the <tl>molds</tl> where there are gates of <m>wax</m>, in order
that it melts well &amp; leaves nothing inside.</ab></div>

<ab>They are molded like <al>crayfish</al> <fr>en noyau</fr>, first on
one side, that which is hollow being raised up with <m>clay</m>, &amp; then
one uncovers them from the other side &amp; one makes the second
casting. They can also be cast well in <tl>frames</tl>, provided
that they are released easily. If they are not, one models them in
<m>wax</m>, or else one fills the cavities that cannot release
with <m>wax</m> or <m>clay</m>.</ab>

<ab>Because usually <m>filings</m> are mixed with <m>filth</m>, it
is good to redden them in the fire to burn the <m>impurities</m> and then
wash them in <m>clear water</m>. In this way, the dirt will go to the
top of the <m>water</m>, which you throw out, &amp; the <m>good
filings</m> will go to the bottom.</ab></div>

<ab>Because the ones that are cast are usually massive, <del>or

with <m>leaves &amp; sheets of silver</m>.</ab></div>
