engraving, &amp; when these <tl>points</tl> are fatty &amp; cannot bite,
one needs to rub them <m>diamond</m> against <m>diamond</m>. One rubs

needs also to unpolish on a <tl><m>lead</m> wheel</tl> either the
<m>stone</m> or the <m>glass</m> on which you want to engrave, for the
polish, which is like <m>varnish</m> on <m>glass</m>, prevents the
<m>diamond</m> or <m>sapphire</m> from biting well. <del>But</del> This
is why it does not bite easily on the <m><bp>nail</bp></m>, which is
polished &amp; fatty. But when the polish is taken off, it bites
easily.</ab></div>
