<head>Painting plants of <m>metal</m></head>

<ab>If you are in a hurry, it would be better to mix your color with a
not-too-thick <m>gum</m> <del>or</del> because <m>oil</m> takes a
<tmp>long time</tmp> to dry and runs if it is layered thinly,
as the plants require. And if you still want it <add>done</add> promptly,
temper your color with <m>glair</m> beaten with <m>peelings of the <pa>fig tree</pa></m>, 
and your work will soon be dry. But layer it
thinly.</ab>

<head><al>Viper color</al></head>

<ab>

It is the most beautiful <al>snake</al> that can be molded, because it
has very beautiful scales, &amp; hard &amp; transparent. Its true color
is made with good <m>verdigris</m> ground well with some <m>good
vinegar</m>, if it is of <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>. And if it is in some
place darker, fumigate this first color with <m>sulfur</m>, as you
know. And if one needs to lighten and whiten, like under the throat, rub
with <tl><m>coarse linen</m></tl>. <add>The male ejects from its
nature,<comment rid="c_129r_01"/> which is at the bottom, when it is

<head>Molded <pa>roses</pa></head>

<ab>

They are awkward to mold because the petals are very fine &amp; weak
&amp; doubled. But, to <del><fr>obl</fr></del> avoid this, one needs to
anoint them with <m><pa>wheat</pa> oil</m>, which is very dessicative. And having
quickly dried, it firms &amp; stiffens the petals to be able to separate
them &amp; withstand the <m>tempered sand</m>. The same is done with <al>flies</al>,
with <pa>pansies</pa> &amp; similar delicate things, with flowers from
the <pa>caper plant</pa>.</ab>
